<p class="dropcap">The purpose of this volume is to present an adequate
description of all essential things in the
upbuilding of the country, and to supplement
this by good illustrations and maps. Political geography,
being the background of all historical knowledge,
is made a special topic, while the development of government,
foreign relations, the diplomatic adjustment
of controversies, and social and economic conditions,
have been duly emphasized. All sections of the Union,
North, East, South, West, and Far West, receive fair
treatment. Much attention is paid to the causes and
results of our various wars, but only the most significant
battles and campaigns have been described. The
book aims to make distinct the character and public
services of some great Americans, brief accounts of
whose lives are given in special sections of the text.
Towards the end a chapter sums up the services of
America to mankind.</p>

<p class="drop-capi-t">The aim has been to make the narrative so interesting in style as
to attract the student, without sacrificing accuracy or proportion.
For the sake of impressiveness it has been necessary to concentrate
attention upon a relatively small number of topics, but it is
hoped that no important step in the development of modern Europe has
been slighted. English history has been interwoven with continental
history, and colonial development has received careful treatment. Great
pains have been taken to make the bibliographical apparatus really useful
to the undergraduate.</p>

<p class="center">Ready in May, 1910, and published by The Century Co.</p>

<p>◖ Teachers of American history, who are looking for the best text-book for their classes, are
invited to examine this new work of Dr. Forman’s. They will find that it excels:</p>

<p class="hangindent2">1 In the method of unfolding the story of OUR COUNTRY’S
GROWTH</p>

<p class="indent2">The pupils have before them the story of an ever-growing
nation, and step by step they follow its upbuilding
from small beginnings to its present great proportions.</p>

<p class="hangindent2">2 In the special prominence given to the progress of THE
WESTWARD MOVEMENT</p>

<p class="indent2">The story of the marvelous growth of the Middle West,
and of the States further West, is told, it is believed,
with greater fullness than in any previous school history.
The student will see that the greatness of our
history is due as much to the Western States as to
those on the Atlantic seaboard.</p>

<p class="hangindent2">3 In the treatment of THE BIOGRAPHICAL ELEMENT</p>

<p class="indent2">The great leaders of our country stand out as real and
interesting personalities, because the author writes their
lives into the main body of the text.</p>

<p class="hangindent2">4 In the account given of our COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL
AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT</p>

<p class="indent2">Throughout the book frequent surveys are made of
American civilization as it existed at successive stages,
and in these surveys the pupil learns how we have
passed from the simple life of the seventeenth century
to the complex life of to-day.</p>

<p class="hangindent2">5 In the material provided for THE TEACHERS’ ASSISTANCE</p>

<p class="indent2">At the end of the chapters are carefully framed questions
on the text, with review questions that keep constantly
in mind the points that have been gone over,
and with topics for special reading and special references.
In the appendix are comprehensive outlines and
analytical reviews.</p>

<p class="hangindent2">6 In the fullness and richness of ITS MAPS AND ILLUSTRATIONS</p>

<p class="indent2">Entirely new maps have been made for the book, and
the illustrations have been selected from authentic
sources. Many of the pictures are illustrative of Western
life in the early days.</p>

<p class="hangindent2">7 In the CLEARNESS AND INTEREST OF ITS STYLE</p>

<p class="indent2">No student can fail to be attracted by the manner in
which the story is told. The style is simple&mdash;sometimes
almost colloquial&mdash;but never undignified. Every paragraph
in the book is interesting.</p>

<p class="center">More than 400 pages, strongly bound in half leather. Price, $1.00 net.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_193" class="no-break">Freshman History Course at Yale</h2>


<p class="authorheader">BY EDWARD L. DURFEE.</p>

<p>The scope and character of the elementary history course
at Yale<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is determined by a twofold necessity: first, that of
giving a general survey of the main facts of historical development
from the fall of the Roman Empire to modern times
which shall be valuable in itself and profitable to the student,
even though he were to pursue his historical studies no further;
and second, that of providing a course which will fit
into the general scheme of the history curriculum, and serve
as an introduction to the more advanced courses which follow
it. According to the present arrangement, the fields of English
and American History are reserved for succeeding years,
and as a result, the Freshman course is limited to the study
of Continental European History, from 375 A.D. to 1870
or thereabouts.</p>

<p>Although I follow current local usage in speaking of this
course as “Freshman History,” the name is not strictly appropriate;
it is open to Sophomores, and even to upper classmen
under certain limitations and restrictions. The name by
which it is known in the catalogue, History A 1, better expresses
the fact that it is the introductory course which is a
necessary preliminary to all the other history work. As a
matter of fact, the popular name is not seriously in error,
for over four-fifths of the students pursuing it are Freshmen.</p>

<p>The amount of time allotted to the study of the different
epochs is pretty evenly distributed. Beginning with a summary
view of the Roman Empire and an analysis of the
causes of its decline, the work of the first twelve weeks covers
rather thoroughly the history of the Middle Ages to 1250
A.D.; the Renaissance, Reformation, and Religious Wars occupy
the next third of the year; and the spring term has to
suffice for the period from Louis XIV to the Congress of
Vienna. At that point, the course practically ends, for the
events of the nineteenth century are sketched very briefly,
partly because time is lacking, but more particularly for the
reason that a later and more advanced course treats that
period in detail.</p>

<p>Experience has convinced the instructors that any course,
particularly an introductory one, which deals in specious
generalizations and vague trends of development to the exclusion
of a thorough drill in concrete facts will, of necessity,
be a failure; and so the methods of instruction are designed,
first of all, to secure an accurate knowledge of events,&mdash;to
make the student master the fundamental data upon which
any real comprehension of a great movement as a whole
must be based. Of course, this is equivalent to saying that
we do not consider the lecture method adapted to the immaturity
of first year students,&mdash;even the mixture of lecture and
quiz recitations seems to offer too many temptations to irregularity
and slovenliness. Consequently, each of our three
exercises per week is devoted to a thorough test of the student’s
industry by oral questioning and, at frequent intervals,
by short written papers. The fact that the class is
divided into small divisions, averaging only twenty men in
each, makes the desired end comparatively easy of attainment.</p>

<p>In the matter of text-books, three or four are used, chosen
for their supplementary excellencies, and with the additional
object in view of developing in the student an elementary
power of comparison and synthesis,&mdash;an ability to select
facts from different sources and mould them into some sort
of orderly cohesion for presentation in the recitation. The
proof that he has done this is sought, not only in the recitation,
but by inspection of his note-book, in which he is
required to keep a condensed but carefully arranged digest
of the facts gleaned from the various books.</p>

<p>As regards original sources, an experience lasting for a
period of six years has forced upon the unwilling minds of
the instructors the conviction that contemporary material,
as a part of the required reading, cannot be used to advantage
in a general course, so broad in scope as the one we are
considering. The experiment was a thorough one and long
continued,&mdash;in fact, the feeling that we <em>ought</em> to find a
profitable method of using sources lingered long after the
proof had been forced upon us that we could not, and it has
produced no change in the general opinion that such work
is of the utmost value where time is available to pursue it
properly. But in this particular instance, that was precisely
what we could not do, at least not without entirely changing
the character of the course and modifying its relation to the
rest of the curriculum. Source collections are therefore no
longer among the required text-books, but are relegated to
the domain of collateral reading.</p>

<p>Unity and cohesion among the different instructors and
the various text-books is obtained by the use of a syllabus,
blocked off into lessons, each containing in addition to an
outline and the necessary assignments in the text-books,
further references for reading in the larger standard histories
and biographies. Nor is historical geography neglected,
for each student must fill in with colors the successive maps
of an outline atlas.</p>

<p>Casual mention of collateral reading has already been
made, but there now remains to be described the method
by which it is enforced and directed,&mdash;a method which, I
think, is unique and which, judged by its results, would
seem to be the most valuable feature of the course. In the
fall term, which is by far the hardest, owing to the Freshman’s
unfamiliarity with college methods of work and the
difficult character of the text-books used, little is done in
this direction other than to introduce him to the library,
to point out to him the section in which the books are to
be found that are especially reserved for this course, and
to require him to do a fair amount of collateral reading
upon some specific subject, a clear outline of which he must
insert in his note book. But in the winter and spring terms
a much more systematic and thorough drill is undertaken,
a brief description of which follows:</p>

<p>Some time in January or February a topic is assigned
to each student, comparatively restricted in its scope, chosen
from the field of medieval history up to and including the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Renaissance. Within two or three days, at a definitely appointed
time, he meets his instructor in a conference lasting
from twenty minutes to half an hour, and submits a list of
books, magazine articles, essays, etc., which contain material
bearing upon his subject. This list is to be as complete
as the student can make it, and the first object of the conference
is to discover if he has exhausted the possibilities
of the library,&mdash;to find out whether he knows how to use the
various catalogues, the more ordinary aids such as Poole’s
Index, the A. L. A. Index to General Literature, etc., and
whether he is familiar with the location of the reference
shelves and the stacks accessible to him. Satisfied upon
these points, the instructor selects from the list presented
(and perhaps amended) a number of chapters, articles, or
books, as the case may require, from which the student is to
extract and collect in the form of notes material for an
essay on his particular subject. The remaining portion of
the conference period is occupied with describing and explaining
to the student just how these notes are to be
taken.</p>

<p>The method of note taking is the most important matter
in connection with this first piece of work, for here, probably
for the first time in his life, the student is introduced to
this particular application of the card index and filing system.
It is required that each note be taken upon a separate
card, that each card shall have a head line appropriate for
filing purposes, and that there be an accurate volume and
page reference to the book from which each bit of information
was taken. Emphasis is also put upon the fact that
all the reading should be done and all the notes completed
before the essay is begun, and that the essay should be
written solely from the notes, without further reference to
the books; for experience has shown that this is the best
way of proving to the student himself whether his notes have
been well or poorly taken.</p>

<p>It may be urged that twenty or thirty minutes will not
suffice for thorough instruction in such a variety of matters;
it certainly would be impossible if it were not for the fact
that the whole process is simplified by providing each student
in advance with a pamphlet which, besides explaining
briefly all these points, contains also a condensed guide to
the library. With the aid of this, the work of the instructor
is reduced to the task of ascertaining by well-directed questions
just what the student has done, and what he would do
if he were confronted with certain problems which are sure
to arise. And of course, each man is encouraged to consult
the instructor informally at any time in connection with
puzzling points that may crop up.</p>

<p>As before, a definite time limit is set for this part of the
work, and at a second meeting, both the notes and the essay
are handed in; and in addition, directions are at that time
given for the construction of a formal bibliography. This
differs from the preliminary book list which was submitted
at the beginning of the work in the following points: in the
first place, each book is to be properly and formally listed
on a separate card; secondly, reference must be made on
each card, not only to the pages which deal with the student’s
particular topic, but to those where further bibliographical
lists are to be found; again, he is at this time
introduced to and taught to use the principal historical
bibliographies, and required to enter on cards those which
give lists of books on his subject, with an exact reference
to the pages where these lists are to be found, without, however,
copying any titles from these lists; and lastly, he must
make an elementary classification of all his cards by dividing
them into three groups,&mdash;bibliographies, sources and secondary
works.</p>

<p>In the spring term the process is repeated with each
student, certain modifications being introduced, however,
which constitute steps in advance and prevent the men from
viewing the second piece of work as a monotonous repetition
of the first. For instance, the subject is chosen from the
modern period; while the notes and essay are done in the
same manner, a longer time is allowed, and, on the basis of
a sharp criticism of his first theme, much improvement in
these respects is expected; and the character of the bibliography
is entirely changed.</p>

<p>The primary object of the first bibliography, it will be
noticed, was to teach the student how to find <em>all</em> the books
on his subject, how to use the library, catalogues, bibliographies,
etc. In the case of the second, we endeavor to teach
him how to find the <em>best books</em>; in other words, we require a
selected and critical bibliography, and insist that no book
be entered unless its card bears a statement of its comparative
value by some recognized authority. To secure such
statements the student must, of course, in addition to using
the usual bibliographies critically and selectively, search for
book reviews in the various reputable magazines, historical
and otherwise. As an additional incentive, a prize, named
for the Hon. Andrew D. White, is awarded to the author of
the best piece of work.</p>

<p>This system was evolved from tentative experiments lasting
three years, and has now been in operation, in its present
form, for three more; and it seems to be the opinion of
competent judges that it is an unqualified success. In the
first place, it teaches the student a great deal, not only about
particular phases of European history, but more especially
about methods of work which will stand him in good stead in
all his future courses; and while it demands much of him,
the requirements are all so carefully graded and the work so
progressive in character that at no time is he overwhelmed
by the amount suddenly thrust upon him. And another
feature that deserves emphasis is the care taken to prevent
each man from slighting any part of the process; during the
time he is at work on his two themes he must meet his
instructor in no less than five personal consultations which
punctuate at carefully chosen times the various stages of the
work.</p>

<p>The obvious difficulty that the system demands too much
of the instructor is met by the fact that the History Department,
as well as the whole Faculty, have shown their appreciation
of the results obtained by lightening the ordinary
work of teaching to an extent that permits the teacher to
carry this extra burden without undue effort.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_194">THE WRITINGS OF WILLIAM PENN.</h2>

<p>An interesting announcement has been made by Albert
Cook Myers, of Moylan, Pa., concerning a plan for the publication
of the complete works of William Penn. It is noteworthy
that there is no edition of Penn’s works which is
nearly complete. The fullest edition, that of 1726, is difficult
to obtain. The later editions of 1771, 1782 and 1823
contain but a small portion of his works. Yet even the
first edition contains but twenty per cent. of the works
which were published during Penn’s lifetime. Of the eleven
hundred known letters of Penn only one hundred and
twenty-five have ever been printed. The aim of Mr. Myers
is to obtain a guarantee from members of the Society of
Friends and others of a fund amounting to $18,000, which
will be sufficient to defray the expense incident to making
such a collection. A committee of the Historical Society
of Pennsylvania has been appointed to co-operate with Mr.
Myers in this publication. The committee includes Hon.
Samuel W. Pennypacker, William Brooke Rawle, Charlemagne
Tower, John Bach McMaster, Isaac Sharpless, William
I. Hull, and William Penn-Gaskell Hall. Persons
willing to assist in this work either by the contribution of
funds or by the loaning of manuscripts are requested to
correspond with Mr. Myers.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_202">The Tower of Knowledge</h2>


<p class="authorheader">DESCRIBED BY PROFESSOR PAUL MONROE, TEACHERS’ COLLEGE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.</p>

<p>Among the many symbolical representations
of the world of learning or schemes
of intellectual pursuits or of educational institutions
furnished by the Middle Ages or
the Renaissance period, none is more interesting
and few more complete than the
accompanying illustration from the “Margarita
Philosophica” of Gregorovius de
Reisch (or George Reisch).</p>

<p>Reisch was prior of the Carthusian monastery
at Freiburg and confessor of the
Emperor Maximilian I. Noted for his
learning, he published one of the briefest,
but also one of the most popular of the
numerous cyclopedias of learning produced
during the late mediæval and early modern
centuries. This work, the “Margarita Philosophica,”
first appeared at Heidelberg in
1496, and went through numerous editions,
eight of them appearing by 1535. While
the substance of the work was mediæval, it
was tinged by the dawning modern spirit,
as is shown by the title and by a consciousness
of the significance of the Renaissance
period by the claim set forth in the title to
the incorporation of additions to “all
known things.” The full title reads: The
“Margarita Philosophica,” or the “Philosophical
Pearl: treating of all known
things; with additions, such as are to be
found nowhere else.” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aepitoma Omnis
Phylosophiae, Alias Margarita Phylosophica
Tractans de omni genere scibili: Cum additionibus:
Que in alijs non habentur.</i>)</p>

<p>The first seven books treat of the seven
liberal arts, the eighth and ninth of natural
phenomena; the tenth, eleventh and the
twelfth of the soul. These twelve books
are divided into 573 chapters containing an
epitome of the knowledge of the day.
Much of the value of the work to present
day students depends upon the numerous
illustrations of symbolic character. One of
the most important of these is the accompanying
Tower of Knowledge, which gives
the whole scheme of education of that
period.</p>

<p>The youthful victim is admitted to the
Tower by the Muse of Wisdom, who presents
to him the horn book. Once admitted
he begins the toilsome progress through
various chambers of the tower which correspond
to the twelve books of the treatise,
namely, the first eight to the seven liberal
arts, grammar being given, not only two
chambers but two entire floors. The first
chamber is devoted to Donatus, whose “Eight
parts of speech,” written about 400 A.D.,
formed the traditional approach to all
studies for many centuries. So nearly universal
was the use of this part of Donatus’
larger work on grammar, that the term
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">donat</i> came into frequent use as a synonym
for an introduction into any subject.
Donatus continued very popular into the
16th or even 17th century, though its popularity
was successfully contested by many
later works, especially that of Alexander
de Villa Dei of the 13th century.</p>

<p>The second chamber is devoted to Priscian,
whose more elaborate work on grammar
(from about 526 A.D.) formed the
source of much of the common literary
knowledge of the middle ages. Priscian
was one of the works most frequently issued
from the early press, and yet exists
in more than a thousand manuscripts. In
all Priscian quotes more than 250 authors,
several of them more than 100 times, the
“Æneid” of Vergil more than seven hundred
times. Thus the study of Latin grammar
was of far greater significance than
the modern conception of the term indicates
and justifies to Reisch the assignment of
two floors of the Tower.</p>

<p>From the study of grammar the youth
proceeds to the study of rhetoric and poetry,
the middle one of the three rooms of the
third floor. Cicero is here the presiding
genius. From rhetoric the student proceeds
to the logic of Aristotle, thus completing
the trivium.</p>

<p>The first subject of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quadrivium</i> is
arithmetic, represented by Boethius. The
remaining three subjects of the quadrivium
form the fourth floor. These are astronomy,
represented by Ptolemy; geometry, by
Euclid, and music by Pythagoras.</p>

<p>Following the quadrivium come the subjects
which no doubt represent “the additions
to known things” in the mind of the
compiler. These are the physical sciences,
typified by Pythagoras, and Moral Philosophy,
by Seneca. Crowning all comes the
study of theology and metaphysics, represented
by Peter the Lombard, whose “Sentences”
had been the orthodox theological
text now for two centuries.</p>

<p>The symbolic illustrations which accompany
the book of the treatise on these several
subjects are of no less interest than
the tower of knowledge itself; for these
go into great detail in exposition of the
aim and characteristic features of each
study. Such illustrations present in a concrete
way the curricula and the methods
of school work in the past.</p>

<p class="subtitleheader">The Situation in Great Britain</p>

<p class="authorheader">BY JOHN HAYNES, PH.D., DORCHESTER HIGH SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS.</p>

<p>In the last article of this series it was
stated that the rejection by the House of
Lords of the Budget of 1909 brought before
the British people not only a fundamental
question of taxation, but the constitutional
question of the position of the Upper
House. For centuries it had been generally
conceded that the authority over finance
belonged exclusively to the House of Commons.
But the Lords in 1909, claiming
that the new proposals were revolutionary,
passed a resolution respecting the budget,
“that this House is not justified in giving
its consent to this bill until it has been
submitted to the judgment of the country.”
The Commons answered by another
resolution that this action was “a breach
of the Constitution and a usurpation of
the rights of the Commons.” Nevertheless
it was necessary for the ministry to dissolve
Parliament in January 1910, and
carry the issue before the voters. In the
campaign the Liberals stood for the budget,
the denial of the right of the Lords to
reject it, and home rule for Ireland. The
Labor party, in addition to supporting the
views of organized labor on questions affecting
working men, were strongly in
favor of the budget. The Irish Nationalists,
as always, put Irish home rule before
everything else. The Conservatives, under
the name of Unionists, which they use to
emphasize their opposition to home rule,
made their campaign chiefly on the issue of
“tariff reform,” which in Great Britain
means the abandonment of her free trade
policy. Sentiment in favor of doing this
has greatly increased in recent years, and
those who favor it are supplied with much
greater financial resources for pushing their
views than those who uphold the present
policy. It would not surprise the present
writer to see Great Britain return to the
“protective” system, though he believes it
would be a misfortune of the greatest
magnitude to the British people.</p>

<p>The resolution passed by the Lords when
they rejected the budget implied that an
election would be in the nature of a referendum,
and so it was to a certain extent,
but it was a very imperfect one. The
law which permits plural voting was, as
always, a great disadvantage to the Liberals,
and undoubtedly lost them several
seats. Again, there has been no distribution
of seats since 1885, and the present
arrangement is grossly inequitable. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
an extreme example the member from Romford
represents over seventeen times as
many voters as the member from Whitehaven.
The Liberals and Labor party are
the ones who suffer from this condition.
Ireland, whose representation is wholly
Nationalist and Conservative, has one-fourth
more members of Parliament than
she is justly entitled to. Another thing
which helped the Conservatives were “three-cornered
contests” which gave them at least
five seats as representatives of districts
where the Liberal and Labor voters together
far outnumbered the Conservatives. Then,
again, the question was so confused with
other matters that there was not a direct
issue on the budget. Doubtless many free
traders voted for Unionist candidates from
opposition to Irish home rule or the policy
of the Liberals on the school and liquor
questions. It is the misfortune of the
Liberals that their progressive policies at
the same time encounter the three powerful
interests represented by the landholders,
the liquor dealers, and the Anglican
Church. In Ireland the home rule question
so overshadowed all others that there was
no expression whatever of popular opinion
on the budget, though enough is known to
make it pretty certain that the majority
would be against it. In England, Wales and
Scotland, the popular majority of the Liberals
and Laborites combined in spite of
plural voting, was nearly three hundred
thousand. It may be concluded that notwithstanding
the growth of sentiment adverse
to free trade the Lloyd-George budget
would be adopted by a safe margin if it
were submitted as a simple question to the
British people. The actual result was the
choice of 274 Liberals, 273 Conservatives, 82
Irish Nationalists and 41 Labor members,
a situation which gives the Irish Nationalists
under the leadership of John Redmond
the balance of power.</p>

<p>The new Parliament met February 15th.
The King’s speech was very brief and foreshadowed
the re-introduction of the budget
and proposals for giving the House of Commons
undivided authority over finance and
preponderance in all legislation. This
speech from the throne contained the altogether
unusual phrase “in the opinion of
my advisers.” The motion of the Unionists
to amend the King’s speech by inserting
a resolution in favor of “tariff reform”
was defeated by the votes of the Liberals
and Laborites, the Irish Nationalists abstaining
from voting. From the opening of
Parliament till the 24th of March the time
has been occupied with necessary routine
work, but it has become evident from the
attitude of Mr. Redmond and the more
radical supporters of the ministry that the
question of curbing the power of the Lords
must take precedence of the consideration
of the budget. If the Nationalists are satisfied
by the action of the ministry on this
question the budget will probably pass the
Commons, the Irish members either voting
for it or abstaining from voting.</p>

<p>For the present, the question of the power
of the House of Lords has become paramount.
It is recognized even by the Conservatives
that the present situation is indefensible.
The fact that the membership
of the House of Lords is overwhelmingly
conservative leads to what is practically a
government by a single chamber when the
Conservatives are in the majority in the
Commons. It has been possible for Conservative
ministries to put through measures,
like the Education Act of 1902, which
have never been submitted to the country
and would probably not be approved if
submitted. On the other hand when the
Liberals are in power the Lords by rejecting
and mutilating legislation have prevented
the principal Liberal measures from becoming
law. The only recourse of the Liberals
would be to appeal to the country on
every question of any importance. March
23d the House of Lords by a vote of 175 to
17 adopted a set of resolutions introduced
by Lord Rosebery, which are likely to become
the Conservative platform on the question.
They are: “First, that a strong and
efficient Second Chamber is not merely an
integral part of the British Constitution,
but is necessary to the well-being of the
State and the balance of Parliament.</p>

<p>“Second, that a strong and efficient Second
Chamber can best be obtained by the
reform and reconstruction of the House
of Lords.</p>

<p>“Third, that a necessary preliminary to
such reform and reconstruction is the acceptance
of the principle that the possession
of a peerage should no longer itself give the
right to sit and vote in the House of
Lords.”</p>

<p>It will be noticed that this resolution is
non-committal on the question of how the
voting members shall be chosen. The suggestions
which have found their way into
print are that the Peers should choose a certain
part of their own number, that county
councils should elect, that learned societies
should be represented, and that men who
had held high posts should be voting members.
It has been stated that there would
be a number of life peers. The proposal is
very indefinite, and furnishes no guarantee
on the most necessary point, namely, that
the Second Chamber must be one which will
not forever defeat the measures of the Liberals
when they have a majority of the
Commons. It would seem that the only logical
position of those who favor a strong
upper house would be to have it elected
from larger districts and for longer terms
than the House of Commons.</p>

<p>The Liberals, however, have not adopted
such a plan. On March 22d, Prime Minister
Asquith gave notice of three resolutions
which will probably for some time or until
carried out constitute the platform of the
Liberals and their allies. The first declares
it expedient that the House of Lords
be disabled by law from rejecting any
money bill. The second that it is expedient
that the powers of the House of Lords
over other bills be restricted so that any
such bill which has passed the House of
Commons for three successive sessions and
has been rejected by the House of Lords in
each of these sessions shall become a law
without the consent of the House of Lords
provided that not less than two years have
elapsed between the introduction of a bill
and its becoming law. The third resolution
proposes to limit the duration of each
Parliament to five years. These proposals
possess the advantage of definiteness which
the Rosebery resolutions lack. They are
obviously open to the charge of proposing
a one-chambered government. Late dispatches
seem to indicate that these resolutions
have been approved by the leaders
of the Nationalists and Laborites, and that
at no distant day Premier Asquith will
again go to the country with these propositions
instead of the budget as the chief
issue, for the resolutions are certain to be
rejected by the Lords.</p>

<p>In the interval between the preparation
of this article (March 28th) and its publication,
it is probable that events will move
rapidly in Great Britain, but the writer
hopes that this and the preceding article
on the budget will furnish in brief form a
useful historical background for such
events as may take place.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_204">European History in the Secondary School</h2>


<p class="authorheader">D. C. KNOWLTON, PH.D. Editor.</p>

<p class="subtitleheader">THE UNIFICATION OF ITALY.</p>


<h3>Italy in Its Relation to Europe.</h3>

<p>The history of the unification of Italy
is so closely connected with developments
outside the peninsula that it is difficult to
make the details of the story intelligible,
and at the same time preserve the proper
European perspective. In order to link
together the various episodes which mark
the appearance of this new state, the
teacher must, of necessity, direct the attention
of the class to ground already
traversed, besides anticipating in a measure
certain events which call for fuller
treatment later. There is, then, an unparalleled
opportunity for review; but a very
real difficulty arises when the instructor
has occasion to refer to such events as the
Six Weeks’ War or the Franco-Prussian
War, which have not yet been taken up in
their European setting. In view of these
problems it might be advisable to review
some of these details after the story of
German unification has been told, making
the year 1871 an occasion for a retrospect
of the history of the preceding quarter of
a century. In this way the importance of
this period may be brought home forcibly
to the class. “With the Crimean War
began a period of wars and territorial
changes. In sixteen years there were four
European wars between great powers, not
to mention the local wars in Italy and Denmark;
all central Europe was rearranged.”
(Seignobos, p. 787.) “Indeed the changes
made in the map of Europe between 1850
and 1871 were in some respects greater
than the final results of the warfare which
ended in that great pacification.” (The
reference here is to the Congress of
Vienna.)<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>


<h3>The Central Theme.</h3>

<p>The main points which call for emphasis
at the hands of the instructor have been
summed up by Seignobos in the following
statement: “The union of Italy was accomplished
by all the Italian advocates of
unity, royalists and republicans, working in
harmony with the Piedmontese government,
aided by a great European power, first
France, then Prussia (p. 351).” Possibly
additional interest may be aroused by suggesting
the thought that here was the unusual
spectacle of a nation made one, “not
by conquest, but by consent.” This idea
may be brought out best by comparison.</p>


<h3>Obstacles to Union.</h3>

<p>The chief obstacles to a union of the
various states of Italy afford a proper
introduction to the story. The most important
of these was undoubtedly the presence
of the foreigner. Italy had long been “a
geographical expression,” controlled in the
interest of an extra-Italian power. Dismemberment
was its normal condition. A
series of maps might be prepared to illustrate
this fact, using a vivid color to indicate
the territory controlled, first by Spain,
then by Austria, then by France, and again
by Austria, according to the arrangements
made at Vienna. The following subjects
are suggested:</p>

<p>(1) The Spanish Hegemony; (2) Beginning
of Austria’s power in Italy (1715);
(3) Restoration of Spain’s power in Italy,
including the Austrian possessions in the
peninsula (1735); (4) Italy in the time of
Napoleon (1810); and (5) Power of Austria
in Italy after the Congress of Vienna,
showing the Sardinian territories (1815).
These maps will serve the purpose best if
not over three colors are used in their construction.
The atlases of Dow and Putzger,
and such text-books as Robinson and West
will supply the necessary details. The
constant reappearance on each of these
maps of a black band stretching across the
peninsula will serve to emphasize the importance
of another hindrance to Italian
unity, namely, the temporal power of the
papacy.</p>


<h3>Italy After the Revolution of 1848.</h3>

<p>The discussion of Italian politics from
1815 to 1840 will be determined in part by
the plan which the teacher has adopted for
the treatment of this period in its general
European aspect. Whatever line of treatment
has been pursued, 1840 marks the real
point of departure for presenting the facts
connected with the formation of the kingdom
of Italy. This date affords an opportunity
for summing up the condition of the
peninsula and for pointing out some of the
lessons taught by the February Revolution.
The next ten years constitute “the period
of preparation.” Ten more were consumed
before the hopes of the advocates of unity
had been fully realized&mdash;if indeed they can
be said to have been altogether realized.
One of the first problems confronting the
makers of modern Italy was the welding
together of the widely scattered territories,
occupied by diversified elements and possessing
but few interests in common, which
were known as the kingdom of Sardinia.
(Read Seignobos, p. 346.) If Sardinia was
to lead in the movement for unity and independence
she must be thoroughly organized
and prepared to assume the financial and
military burdens involved. Not the least of
her problems was that of “convincing all
Italian Liberals that she could be trusted;”
that she was their Heaven-sent leader. The
task was all the more difficult because of
the humiliation she had so recently undergone
at the hands of Austria. Piedmont,
however, had “failed heroically,” and, in
spite of Novara, still remained “the center
of nationalist hopes.” Two things were
patent to the keen student of affairs, first,
that Sardinia alone could not drive out
the foreigner, and second, that any attempt
at union must not be imperiled in the
future by differences of opinion as to the
nature thereof.</p>


<h3>The Great Personalities.</h3>

<p>Four great personalities fill the period
from 1840 to 1860&mdash;“each was complementary
in his life work to the other”&mdash;Mazzini,
Cavour, Garibaldi, and behind them
all, displaying rare wisdom and common
sense at every crisis, the warrior king, Victor
Emmanuel II. Mazzini has been called
the Prophet of Italian unity; Cavour, its
Statesman; and Garibaldi, its Knight-Errant.
Of these three, Mazzini is most
difficult to understand. The secondary student
will find it next to impossible to
enter into the far-reaching, although somewhat
Utopian, schemes of this great Italian
publicist. It is enough perhaps to point out
how, by organizing Young Italy, he created
the necessary enthusiasm among his countrymen
to make possible the work of
Cavour and Garibaldi.</p>

<p>Neither is Cavour’s public career devoid of
difficulties. The attention of the class
should be confined here to his efforts to
place Sardinia on a sound economic basis,
and at the same time secure for her the
support and friendship of the great powers
of Europe. The ambitions of Napoleon III,
who dominated European politics prior to
1870, were utilized by the great state-maker
in the furtherance of these plans. (See also
Cesaresco, Cavour, Preface, for an outline
of the policy of Cavour.)</p>


<h3>The Attainment of Unity.</h3>

<p>When the “epoch of realization” (1859-1870)
has been reached, several plans are
open to the instructor for presenting the
various steps in the process of state-making.
Beginning with the Crimean War, it
is possible to associate the various acquisitions
of territory with the wars which
fill the period, namely, the Austro-Sardinian
War, the Six Weeks’ War and the Franco-Prussian
struggle; or to deal with the successive
additions of territory as such, emphasizing
the date and circumstances attending
each. (See Seignobos, p. 351.) In
the first case, emphasis is placed on the
means employed; in the second, on the end
attained. In either case reference should
be made to the eagerness of the people to
join with Sardinia, as shown in the plebiscites.
If the second plan be followed, it will
be easier to introduce Garibaldi. The episode
of the Thousand offers material for an
interesting report. In this connection mention
might be made of a recent work by
G. M. Trevelyan, Garibaldi and the Thousand.</p>


<h3>Literature.</h3>

<p>Out of the great mass of material on this
subject mention might be made of the following:
Seignobos, Europe since 1814,
Chaps. XI and XXVII (one of the best accounts);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Judson, Europe in the Nineteenth
Century, Part II, Chap. X, and Part III,
Chap. XIV (clear and interesting); Phillips,
Modern Europe, Chap. XV; Cesaresco,
Liberation of Italy; Cesaresco, Cavour; and
Stillman, Union of Italy, 1815-1895. The
two authors last mentioned represent
somewhat different points of view. The
Countess Cesaresco waxes eloquent as she
unfolds her story. Stillman is inclined to
take a less roseate view of the manner and
means whereby Italy won her place among
the nations. Marriott, “Makers of Modern
Italy,” will also be found very helpful
and suggestive. The list might be increased
materially, but the books which
have been cited will not only be found
helpful, but may readily be secured from
most libraries.</p>

<h3>Choice of Material.</h3>

<p>There remain to us but two of these studies
of the Roman world; but two short
months of school in which to cover tragic
centuries of European development. A
stern self-restraint in the choice of topics
to be treated is necessary therefore, both
for the articles and for the school. The
welter of detail is all but overwhelming;
and the teacher must select a few salient
features of these eight centuries. For the
present month we may consider what is
worth while down to the so-called “fall of
Rome.”</p>


<h3>The Two Good Centuries.</h3>

<p>From the time when the new empire settled
down into peace under Augustus to the
death of Marcus Aurelius in 180 A.D. there
came a period, when, as has been well said,
the Mediterranean basin was probably
more prosperous, more happy and better
governed than at any time before or since.
This is not always understood and accepted.
The evil side of Tiberius, Caligula, Nero,
Domitian, the turmoil under Galba and his
two successors, have been unduly emphasized.
Probably there has been too much
“muck-raking” even by eminent historians.
Under the worst of the rulers named it is
to be remembered that tyranny and cruelty
were almost totally confined to the capital
and its cliques. The provinces were on the
whole well administered, especially in comparison
with the corruption of later republican
times. Within this period, too, fall
the Golden and the Silver Ages of Roman
literature.</p>


<h3>The Disastrous Third Century.</h3>

<p>From Marcus Aurelius to Diocletian
stretches an evil century. The rocks upon
which Rome was finally to be shipwrecked
began to show their heads. Government
again became a prey instead of a service.
The “barrack emperors”&mdash;“the thirty tyrants”
cursed the imperial chair. The German
barbarians began to press hard upon
the borders of the empire. Pestilence, imported
from the East, thinned the already
weakened population. The army came to
be almost wholly recruited, and in a large
degree officered by Germans. It was almost
as if Great Britain depended solely for her
defense upon Hindoo troops, for lack of men
and mettle among the English themselves.
Then came the spasm of reform under
Aurelian. And meantime the barbarians by
scores of thousands at first, and soon by
hundreds of thousands, came drifting down
from the north and east. Their comings
were quiet enough at the first. They simply
moved in where Romans had largely
died out. We might compare it in some
ways to what would happen if our country
should allow a free immigration of Orientals
into our Pacific slope.</p>


<h3>Reorganization.</h3>

<p>The fourth century saw the great reforms
under Diocletian and Constantine. The empire
was reorganized and, for the time
being, strengthened. But the new vigor
was vicious in type. It was oriental despotism
thinly disguised, as shown by the
strange new garb of the emperors, no
longer great generals and first citizens;
and by the horde of office-holders with
novel, high-sounding titles fitted to the
various grades of the new bureaucracy.</p>

<p>A line of cleavage was developed by the
establishment of the double capital and the
joint emperors. East and West began to
separate. The division was in part dictated
by the difficulty of administering the
vast empire from one center in a period
when communication was incredibly slow as
compared with our modern facilities of
steam and electricity. And in this division
was a double seed. From one kernel was
to spring disaster for Italy and the West.
From the other was to germinate the
Eastern Empire, destined to be the fortunate
and stupid conservator of culture and
learning throughout the dark ages.</p>


<h3>Christianity.</h3>

<p>With the fourth century the Christian
faith began to assert itself as never before.
Its persecution, off and on, for three centuries,
and its triumph need a little study.
Why was it that the Roman system could
tolerate the excesses of the licentious
Eleusinian and Bacchic orgies and the foul
superstitions of Egypt, but could find no
charity for a pure and gentle faith? Because
Christianity was itself righteously intolerant.
Very early in the history of the
empire it became the fashion and then the
law that the genius of the emperor should
be adored. To the already polytheistic
citizen of the empire this was no added
hardship. One god more made no difference
to him, and the cynical Roman magistrate
could not understand why the
wretched Christian was so stubborn about
a pinch of incense in honor of the emperor.
It meant so little to him religiously&mdash;but
everything to the Christian. And so the
Christians died by thousands. Yet the persecuted
faith spread apace, drawing into its
fold of hope and inward peace the wayworn
travelers upon the cruel road of life in
those weary years. Then came the conversion
of Constantine and the gradual disintegration
of paganism. For a study of the
brighter side of pagan life and a proof that
the whole Roman world, as so often taught,
was not thoroughly rotten, read Pater’s
“Marius, the Epicurean,” and Dill’s
“Roman life in the Fourth Century.”</p>


<h3>The Barbarians.</h3>

<p>It is surprising to the judicious what can
be the effect of a word or phrase. Probably
the term “barbarian” has caused as
much confusion in the minds of young students
of history as any other term. It
signifies to him at least a semi-savage.
Yet we know that to the Greek it meant
only a non-Hellene. In the later Roman
times it meant Goth or German. And yet,
long before these people finally disrupted
the Western Empire, they had ceased to be
barbarian in any common conception of the
term. If we substitute for the word migration
the longer word immigration, it will
give a better idea of their earlier comings,
to which allusion has already been made.
Humbler neighbors from without the pale,
they slowly crept into the southern space
and glow out of their crowded and unlovely
north. With no ideas of conquest
at first, but seeking betterment for themselves,
as to-day come the peoples from the
same Russia; or, pressed out of their own
hunting grounds by the atrocious Hun,
they poured steadily in. And long before
they became a menace, most of them had
become at least half civilized by contact
with the finer south. Their men had many
of them served in the Roman legions. And
Christianity had early made way among
them. And at length, when the weakness
of the West made it an easy prey to their
greater vigor, it was not as bands of
whooping savages falling upon a peaceful
white settlement that they came, but they
simply took up the scepter of destiny which
nerveless and unworthy hands had let fall.
Emerton’s “Introduction to the Middle
Ages,” and the early chapters of Adams’
“Civilization during the Middle Ages,” furnish
the best of reading for topics like these
just suggested.</p>


<h3>The Fall of Rome.</h3>

<p>There never was such a thing. That is
putting it bluntly. But no contemporary
historian uses such a phrase. It is another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of the fables of history which need correction.
To the Italian the sending of the
imperial insignia from Rome to Constantinople
meant no more than the Rhode
Islander understood when Newport ceased
to be one of the capitals of his State.
There was no longer need for an emperor
at Rome; that was all. The Goth who
was in control there had been so for a generation,
and considered himself just as
good a subject of the emperor at Constantinople
after the deposition of Augustus as
he had been before.</p>

<p>In teaching children it will be hard to
treat the subject in the way just indicated.
Probably a little analysis of the causes of
this “fall of Rome” will seem logically
necessary. Some such outline as the following
might be tolerated. But let the teacher
bear in mind that no historian has yet
succeeded in giving such a set of reasons
for this fall as will satisfy any other historian.
The child mind, however, is not
critical, and may be helped by a catalogue
of forces.</p>

<p>A. As political causes:</p>

<p class="hangrome">Failure to govern justly.</p>

<p class="hangrome">Growth of militarism.</p>

<p class="hangrome">Lack of home rule, and of representation.</p>

<p class="hangrome">The administrative division of the
empire.</p>

<p>B. As social and economic causes:</p>

<p class="hangrome">Steady decline in population, resulting
from vice, war, pestilence and
Christian asceticism.</p>

<p class="hangrome">Slavery, as depicted in the preceding
article, and now grown still more
dreadful.</p>

<p class="hangrome">Taxation, so oppressive that a Christian
writer says there were more collectors
than payers of taxes.</p>

<p>C. As military causes:</p>

<p class="hangrome">The cessation of military service by
Italians and the use of Germanic
soldiers.</p>

<p>D. As moral and religious causes:</p>

<p class="hangrome">The vice fostered by a corrupt court.</p>

<p class="hangrome">The general decline of morals among
a weakened and disheartened people.</p>

<p>Over against all these are to be set the
numbers, the virility, the comparative freedom
from civilized vices, of the sturdy barbarians;
and most of all their capacity for
absorbing the worthiest things among the
people whom they conquered.</p>

<p class="subtitleheader">RECENT AMERICAN HISTORY.</p>


<h3>The New Era.</h3>

<p>By the year 1876 or 1877, the period of
Reconstruction may be said to have come
to an end. From that time on the people
of the United States were busy developing
new ideas and attempting to settle new
problems. Only gradually, however, did
they recognize this fact; not till the end
of the nineteenth century did the country
awake to a full realization that the old
order was no more, that a new order had
come into existence. Just because this new
order has been so recently born, however,
because so many of its elements are so
imperfectly understood, the teacher will
probably find special difficulties in teaching
it to his classes.</p>


<h3>The Age of Extra-Continental Expansion
and of New Economic Development.</h3>

<p>To begin with, the student must be taught
that this last generation in America has
witnessed two almost entirely new developments:
(1) the extra-continental expansion
of the United States, and (2) the
growth of enormous combinations of labor
and of capital. The first reached its climax
in the Spanish-American War, the acquisition
of the Philippines and of Porto
Rico, the assumption of a quasi-protectorate
over the republics of Central America,
and the interference in the affairs of China
and Japan. With the details of this movement
we shall not attempt to deal in this
article. Instead we shall devote all of our
space to a consideration of the second
series of events.</p>

<p>The history and the results of the growth
of these large combinations of labor and
of capital present themselves in three more
or less distinct phases: (a) the struggle
of the laborer for his full share in the distribution
of wealth; (b) the development
of capitalistic enterprise through the large
corporations; and (c) the effort of the consumer
to keep from being crushed by the
weight of the two contending forces.</p>

<p>Though the interest of the consumer in
these new economic problems is destined,
in the opinion of many students, to become
the paramount one, up to the present time
it has received but little direct attention
from constructive statesmen, and it does
not, therefore, properly belong among the
subjects to be discussed in the history class
room. The teacher may, nevertheless, call
the attention of his students to the evidences
of the beginning of the definite movement
to protect the interests of the consumer:
the recent Pure Food Acts, the
legislation of the various states designed
to limit the profits of railway and other
public service corporations, and the widespread
agitation of the present day over
the high cost of living.</p>


<h3>The Labor Problem.</h3>

<p>In studying the labor problem, our investigations
must begin as far back as the
middle of the last century when the first
trade unions were organized in the United
States. Since then they have grown steadily
till to-day they number their members
in the millions. In the beginning, these
unions were limited to one locality and to
men who were working in the same trade;
gradually, however, they broadened their
scope till they became national in their
limits and universal in the class of workmen
who were eligible to membership. In
presenting the movement, it will be well for
the teacher to select some thoroughly typical
trade union, such as the Brotherhood
of Railway Engineers, some thoroughly typical
amalgamated union, such as the American
Federation of Labor, for purposes of
illustration. To get the class to investigate
the history of these unions as far as
possible, and to confine the discussion to
their activities will be the teacher’s duty,
else the study will result in hopeless confusion.</p>

<p>The principal weapons of the unions have
been the strike and the boycott. The history
of the use of both of these should be
followed briefly. Then should come the
consideration of the counterblast which the
corporations and the consumer have recently
called to their aid: the judicial injunction
(study the history of the Debs case and the
more recent Bucks Stove Case), and the
application of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act
of 1890 to the labor unions as associations
in restraint of trade (study the Danbury
Hatters’ Case, in which the decision of the
Court was issued only a few months ago).</p>


<h3>The Railroad Problem.</h3>

<p>In studying the history of the large corporations,
it pays in the beginning to indicate
clearly the difference between (1)
public service corporations, those which
enjoy partial or complete monopoly under
franchises granted by the government, and
(2) industrial corporations, whose operations
do not differ essentially from the enterprises
of single individuals, except in
the amount of capital which they command.
Public service corporations may again be
divided into two classes: (1) the interstate
railroads, and (2) those corporations whose
business is local in its nature, such as the
street railroad, the water companies and the
gas companies.</p>

<p>Attacking the problem of the interstate
railroads first, the class must begin its work
by studying the history of the growth of
the great trunk lines, like the New York
Central and the Pennsylvania, and of the
transcontinental railroads, like the Union
Pacific and the Northern Pacific. Next in
order will come the story of the vicious
practices which grew out of the excessive
competition among these railroads: rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
wars, unfair discriminations against localities
and against individual shippers, overcapitalization,
etc.</p>

<p>Early in the ’80’s the railroads themselves
attempted to remedy these evils by forming
the famous pooling associations, but these
pooling associations were later prohibited
by law. Next the individual states attempted
to improve conditions by passing
special railroad codes and by creating state
railroad commissions. Finally, in 1887, the
national government, by the Interstate Commerce
Act attempted to better conditions,
but improvement came but slowly. Since
then, by numerous Court decisions, the most
important of which was the decision in the
Northern Securities Case, and by at least
two amendments to the Interstate Commerce
Act, the Elkins Act of 1903 and the
Hepburn Act of 1907, the national government
has attempted to improve the situation.
Conditions to-day are much better
than they have ever been in the past, but
there is still room for much improvement.</p>


<h3>Municipal Public Service Corporations.</h3>

<p>In discussing local public service corporations,
it is well for the teacher to develop
in the beginning the fact that there are two
possible ways of dealing with them: (1)
municipal ownership, and (2) state regulation.
Even in this country the first
method has been tried to some extent; most
of our largest cities now own their own
water supply, and some of them are in possession
of their own gas and electric light
plants. Thus far, however, most American
states and cities have been content to confine
their activities in dealing with public
service corporation to regulating their
functions and privileges by special legislation
and by establishing special commissions.
Still, the history of the regulation
of public service corporations in this country
is as yet in its beginnings; the teacher
can therefore go but little farther than to
set his students thinking upon the question
as to which is the better method of dealing
with the problem.</p>


<h3>Industrial Corporations.</h3>

<p>Like the trunk lines and the transcontinental
railroads, the great industrial corporations
had their origin in the years following
the period of the Civil War and Reconstruction.
Among these corporations,
the Standard Oil Company is, of course, the
most famous; still, the teacher will do well
to attempt to follow with his class the
history of some other industrial corporation
as well&mdash;if possible, some corporation whose
operations have not stirred up so much
opposition as the Standard Oil Company.
In estimating the effect of these corporations
upon the economic history of the country,
one should attempt to bring out the
benefits which they have bestowed upon the
people as well as the evils which have resulted
from their operations.</p>

<p>In attempting to regulate the activities
of these corporations most states have
passed special laws and established special
commissions. In consequence, the newspapers
are full of accounts of prosecutions
under these laws and by these commissions
and the student should be encouraged to
read them. The national government, too,
has passed at least one law, the famous
Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, with a
view to regulating these great corporations.
More recently still, the Bureau of Corporations
was established, while at the present
time new legislation on this subject is
pending in Congress. Yet with all the agitation
and with all the legislation, it cannot
be said that the problem is even on the
verge of being settled. That will take, in
all probability, at least another generation.</p>


<h3>The Literature of the Subject.</h3>

<p>To recommend one or two, or even half
a dozen books on this period of American
history is impossible. Most of the discussion
is evanescent, and books are antiquated
almost before they have been
printed. For much of the subject matter
to be discussed the student should be sent
to such manuals as (1) the American
Annual Cyclopedia, and (2) the Statesman’s
Year Book. Much valuable material
can also be gleaned from (3) the
annual almanacs published by many of the
larger daily papers. For statutes and government
regulations, the student should
consult (4) MacDonald’s “Select Statutes,”
1861-1898.</p>

<p>Comprehensive and comparatively recent
discussions of these subjects will be found:
(a) on trade unions, in (1) Ely’s, “The
Labor Movement in America;” (2) Adams
and Sumner’s “Labor Problems,” and (3)
Commons’ “Trade Unionism and Labor
Problems;” (b) on railroads, in (1) Hadley’s
“Railroad Transportation;” (2)
Haines’ “Restrictive Railroad Legislation,”
and (3) Ripley’s “Railroad Problems;” (c)
on municipal public service corporations, in
(1) Bemis’ “Municipal Monopolies,” and
(2) Foote’s “Municipal Public Service Industries;”
(d) on industrial corporations,
in (1) Jenks’ “The Trust Problem;” (2)
Ely’s “Monopolies and Trusts;” (3) Ripley’s
“Trusts, Pools and Corporations,” and
(4) Tarbell’s “History of the Standard Oil
Company.” Beside all these the student
will find much that is valuable in the current
reviews and journals, at least one of
which should be in every school library.</p>

<p class="subtitleheader">VIII. THE LATER HANOVERIANS.</p>


<h3>The Industrial Revolution.</h3>

<p>“The period which opened with Arkwright’s
mechanical inventions has been the
commencement of a new era in the economic
history, not only of England, but
of the whole world”&mdash;a new era indeed!
The mind stumbles over the multitude of
forms which this introduction of new
agencies into human endeavor took, the infinite
ramifications of influences set in motion
by machinery. The young of to-day,
satiated, glutted though they are with
machinery, take an interest they could
hardly be expected to feel in more remote
matters in the genesis of the age on whose
still advancing crest we ride: an interest,
however, which is very superficial, very unconscious
of the deeper significance of the
industrial revolution. Some of the “leads”
of that significance are surely to be established
as we approach the subject in the
latter part of the eighteenth century.
Text-books vary greatly in the amount of
information they give as to the first inventions
and the spread of water power devices,
followed by the still greater developments
in the stationary steam engine.
In fact much of the history of invention
is obscure, and the details are entirely too
numerous to give in a school history.
Nevertheless I think the teacher may improve
on the accounts in most of the school
books, both in the way of lucidity and of
vividness. Try a careful study of pp. 505-519
of Beard’s Introduction (which will
take comparatively little of a busy man’s
time), and see how lively and realistic a
tale you can weave out of it&mdash;you will surprise
yourself at the improvement you can
make on your text-book! I say this not
that I honor the text-book less, but the
freedom of oral expression more. Then,
too, one may lead naturally from a sketch
of the changed face of the land to the
changes these new factories wrought in old
England, so stable since the days of the
Conqueror, invaded at last by a ruthless
force irreverent of tradition, triumphing in
disturbing the established order.</p>

<p>But let us beware of resting on generalizations.
“A new era in economic history”
is perfectly worthless as an entrant into
the youthful mind. As well speak of the
cosmic forces in conflict with new physical
entities, or other “Olympian” abstractions.
No, we must descend to the hard pan of
concrete things&mdash;the massing of population,
the rise of a new kind of commerce and a
new kind of market, the making of roads
and canals to serve that commerce and that
market, the changed conditions of the
laborer, and so on. Here, too, is a chance
for “vivid narration,” as the old rhetorics
used to call it, and of all the wiles of a
<em>wise simplicity</em> in instruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Political Revolution.</h3>

<p>From all of which the next step takes us
to the revolution in politics which made
England for the first time a really democratic
country. I suppose it is more than
possible to exaggerate the influence of the
industrial changes upon these political
changes, but the tendency does not seem to
be in that direction. The Wilkes episode
with all its significance, the influence of
the French Revolution pro and con, the general
trend of the age, are factors usually
well built upon. The agitations which
shook the nation in the early nineteenth
century, the focussing of great areas of
population in the new centers of manufacture,
the combination of the sense of industrial
injustice such as was evidenced in
the excesses of the “Luddites,” with the
sense of political injustice of which the
Manchester riots were a symptom&mdash;all this
not only wrought profound differences in
the social fabric of England, but was, I
believe, the greatest single factor in bringing
about the great reform bill. Whether
superlative or comparative there is room
for difference of opinion; but unquestionably
this effect of the actual machine upon
the political machine is to be made a point
of in presenting to the class the drama of
that peaceful (compared with that of other
countries) and salutary transition from a
government altogether of the land holders
to an aristocratic democracy.</p>

<p>This revolution, which crowned the slow
evolution of the British Constitution, which
was so unlike the cataclysm across the
narrow seas, was caused by a series of
events stretching over the backward centuries.
That is a mere truism to our mature
“grown-up” mentality which has a taste
for poking its nose into the roots of things
and for generalizing therefrom.</p>

<p>But not so with the fledgling mentalities
before us&mdash;enough for them that the very
old time struggles helped along; that seeds of
a free spirit were not lacking in the teutonic
blood; and that the events of the seventeenth
century did much to down the pride
and power of royalty. With this much for
a foundation, the ultimate effects of the
new order of industry are comparatively
simple to comprehend, and easy to view,
like the superstructure of the building
which the unseen base supports.</p>


<h3>The Napoleonic Era.</h3>

<p>There is a fascination which all of us
feel, I suppose, both in the French Revolution
and in the looming figure of Napoleon.
It is natural enough, and needs no apology,
but does need some curbing. I should say,
judging from my own experience, when one
must keep sternly in mind that English history
is after all the prescribed route one is
pursuing, and to wander from it is as reprehensible
as for the tourist to deviate a
hair’s breadth from his itinerary. The
temptation to digress is only heightened
by the fact that English matters were
quite nearly concerned in the former, and
might have been said to have been thoroughly
involved in the career of Napoleon.
Then, too, none of the class know anything
worth speaking of about European history,
and here for once, at least, the various
streams of national histories melt into one
river, and Europe becomes a vast theater
for a single drama. All very plausible, but
nevertheless we must not dwell on the
alluring prospect too long or we shall be
lost. The “Continental System,” with its
direct bearing upon England, is less interesting
but perfectly legitimate food for the
English historian or historée. A fairly full
account of it taken from an article by Professor
Sloane is quoted pp. 520 to 537 of
Beard’s Introduction. Much is of course
available on the Peninsular campaign and
Waterloo, not to mention Aboukir Bay and
Trafalgar. Creasy’s account of Waterloo in
the “Fifteen Decisive Battles” is of course
good; but for a bit of reading to the class
for purposes of ignition, nothing that I
know of can equal Victor Hugo’s fiction
(somewhat adorning fact!) in Les Miserables.</p>

<p>A fascinating book on this period if one
can get hold of it (it is expensive, alas, so
I advise borrowing) is Lord Broughton’s
“Recollections of a Long Life,”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which
covers a considerable stretch of time, for a
single life, from 1786 to 1822, and is delightfully
intimate and realistic. I refrain
from suggesting anything concerning Napoleon
having in mind the afore-mentioned
temptation. Nelson and Wellington, on the
other hand, deserve portraits. The later
appearance of the “great Duke,” when he
made so poor a hand at statesmanship is
one of the not infrequent examples of the
soldier out of place in the councils of state.
The extracts pp. 656 to 662 of Cheyney’s
Readings are interesting in this connection.</p>


<h3>Personalities.</h3>

<p>The later eighteenth century teems with
personalities, so that it is difficult not to
crowd the canvas and to nullify all individual
impression by the force of numbers.
George III himself, much blackened by
American semi-traditions of thought is not
as uninteresting or as stupid or as objectionable
as your pupil probably thought
him. A just view of King George is a
worthy aim to set up for at least one
lesson. Lord North, too, always has an
interest for Americans. But far above
these are Pitt and Burke and Fox. O for
the chance to deal with these men as we
ought in the class room; to read what they
said and to examine what they did! Green
has drawn William Pitt the younger in his
best style, pp. 790-791. For Burke one
should go to Augustine Birrell’s “Obiter
Dicta” for an essay that is light in its
touch but keen. Trevelyan gives us Fox,
though at too great length for busy men,
and Macaulay&mdash;well, no class has entirely
received its due unless it has heard the
passage from “The Impeachment of Warren
Hastings,” beginning “The place was
worthy of such a trial. It was the great
hall of William Rufus,” etc.</p>

<p>Time and space fail us, and the age of
reform must wait for discussion until next
number, as well as the methods of review
pertinent to the otherwise pleasant month
of May.</p>

<h3>HIGH SCHOOL RALLY DAY.</h3>

<p>An interesting instance of the influence
of universities upon state high schools is
to be seen in Louisiana. The Louisiana
State University has arranged for an annual
high school rally which this year will be
held on April 29th and 30th. At the rally
there are literary contests in English composition,
in debating, in declamation, in
vocal music, in spelling, in English composition
for the eighth grade, and in history.
There are also many athletic events.
Prizes offered for the literary contests are
usually scholarships in the University. The
following is a description of the exhibit in
history:</p>

<p>“Exhibit of Work in History. The exhibits
may consist of any or all of the
following: Individual notebooks (containing
topical outlines or summaries based
upon the text or upon collateral reading);
papers or reports to be read in the class;
illustrations (pictures and maps); map
work of students (single maps traced or
based on outline maps, or atlases or wall
outline maps filled in).</p>

<p>“No prescribed notebook or map work is
suggested. It is desired that the teacher
use his or her own judgment as to the kind
of work suited to the class.</p>

<p>“The contest is limited to the tenth grade
in each high school. The work of the entire
class is to be exhibited. The grade must
contain not less than five pupils. The
teacher’s certificate as to the number in
class should accompany the exhibit.</p>

<p>“Neatness, accuracy, and good English
will be considered as well as evidence of
proficiency in historical studies.</p>

<p>“It is advised that loose-leaf notebooks
be used. Each should bear the owner’s
name and that of the school. The exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
should be in place in the University Library
not later than 10 a.m. of the first day of
the rally.”</p>

<p>For the best exhibit of work in history
a set of Woodrow Wilson’s “History of the
United States,” five volumes, published by
Harper &amp; Bros., will be given to the school
by Dr. Walter L. Fleming, Professor of History
in the Louisiana State University.</p>


<h3>HISTORY TEACHING IN LONDON.</h3>

<p>A committee of university and training
college instructors and school teachers is
now preparing a report on history teaching
in the London elementary schools. One
chapter of the report, “Aims and Scope of
History Teaching,” has already been prepared
by the sub-committee of which Mr. E.
Bruce Forrest is chairman. The report,
when completed, will be published by the
London County Council.</p>


<h3>HISTORY TEACHERS’ EXAMINATION.</h3>

<p>On May 21st there will be held at the
Barringer High School Building, Newark,
N. J., an examination for high school teachers
of history. The subjects included will
be Ancient history, American history,
Medieval and Modern European history,
English history, and the principles and
methods of teaching history. Graduates of
approved colleges and universities will be
required to take examinations only in these
subjects. Those not college graduates will
be required to pass examinations for the
highest grade elementary certificate. Examinations
are open to both men and
women. The schedule of salaries for positions
are for men $1,400 to $2,500, and for
women from $900 to $1,800, according to
experience and fitness.</p>


<h3>INDIANA ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p>The annual meeting of the History Section
of the Indiana State Teachers’ Association
will be held at Indianapolis on Friday
and Saturday, April 29th and 30th. The
program will begin on Friday afternoon
with a discussion of the Teaching of History
in the Elementary Schools. Professor
H. E. Bourne, a member of the Committee
of Eight, will explain the principles
of the committee’s report. Criticisms of
present methods in teaching history will be
made by City Superintendent Charles F.
Patterson, of Tipton, and by County Superintendent,
Mr. Jesse Webb, of Franklin.
On Friday evening will be a joint meeting
of the Teachers’ Association with the Indiana
Historical Society. Professor Bourne
will speak upon “Our Early Republic as
French Travelers Saw It.” Mr. D. C.
Brown, of the Indiana State Library, will
give an address upon “An Early Indian
War.” On Saturday morning the following
problems of history teaching in the high
school will be discussed:</p>

<p>1. What can be done with the sources?
Miss Minnie Blanche Ellis, Bloomington
High School.</p>

<p>2. Shall a history note book be required?
Mr. W. C. Gerichs, principal, Elwood High
School.</p>

<p>3. How secure results with the collateral
reading? Mr. W. O. Lynch, Department

<h3>ANNUAL MEETING OF THE NORTH
CENTRAL HISTORY TEACHERS’
ASSOCIATION, CHICAGO, APRIL
1 AND 2, 1910.</h3>

<p class="center">REPORTED BY ALBERT H. SANFORD.</p>

<p>It is impossible to convey to one who
was not present an adequate idea of the
spirit that pervaded the first session of the
Twelfth Annual Meeting of the North Central
History Teachers’ Association; this was
the dinner at Reynolds’ Club, University of
Chicago, in honor of Professor Frederick J.
Turner. The menu was simply “Food&mdash;a la
Hutchinson Café.” The “Refreshments”
were talks given by Professors James A.
James, Albion W. Small, Guy S. Ford,
James A. Woodburn, Thomas F. Moran,
and Dr. Reuben G. Thwaites, closing with
remarks by Professor Turner. The printed
program was besprinkled with quotations
from the writings of Professor Turner,
beginning with “The true point of view in
the history of this nation is not the Atlantic
Coast; it is the great West.”</p>

<p>Professor Andrew C. McLaughlin, the presiding
genius of this occasion, pitched the
key at a point somewhere between gay and
sad, running readily from one extreme to
the other. It was, of course, Professor
Turner’s departure from Wisconsin to enter
upon duties at Harvard that called the one
hundred guests to assemble about this table.
Among them were some who had been students
with him in Johns Hopkins’ University,
many who had been students under
his instruction, and still others who are his
colleagues in the field of history throughout
the Central West. Here was spontaneous
testimony to the force and charm of Professor
Turner’s personality, and to the inspiration
of his teaching. Underneath the
gayety of the after-dinner sentiments ran
the note of deep regret that the Central
West loses the presence of this master
mind. No more fitting theme for a session
of the Association could have been selected.</p>

<p>Following the dinner came an address by
Professor Paul S. Reinsch, of the University
of Wisconsin, upon “The Life of the
State and the Teaching of Government.”
Preparation for the duties of citizenship is
less effective in the United States, said
Professor Reinsch, than in other advanced
countries; hence the duty of placing more
emphasis upon the proper teaching of government.
Local government should receive
fuller treatment. There should be more
concrete study of the actual operations of
government and less committing to memory
of the clauses of constitutions that are
only vaguely comprehended. Civil government
should be taught separately from history,
else some of its most important topics
will never be reached; for instance, problems
of city and state organizations. Such,
briefly stated, were some of the points made
in this interesting address.</p>

<p>The session on Saturday morning, April
2d, was fully attended, and interest in the
program which had been arranged by the
president, Carl E. Pray, of the State Normal
School at Milwaukee, held the audience
until a late hour. Miss Lillian Thompson,
of the Englewood High School, Chicago,
gave a spirited and practical talk upon
“The Use of Pictures in History Instruction.”
That Miss Thompson has made a
study of child nature, as well as of pictures,
was evident. She said, the teacher
must put herself in the pupil’s attitude and
must realize his poverty of ideas and mental
images. She must be tactful and sympathetic
in satisfying the pupil’s curiosity,
and in leading him to see the essentials in
pictures. Besides, the teacher must study
the pictures and plan carefully the presentation
of them. Not the lecture but the
question method is the best for lower high
school classes.</p>

<p>Much wisdom, drawn from experience,
was packed into a brief paper read by
Professor G. C. Sellery, of the University of
Wisconsin. This paper cannot be adequately
summarized in a few words. The
old method of teaching history insisted
upon the learning of certain facts by force
of memory. Now we have a higher ideal&mdash;we
ask pupils to understand, rather than
to remember. But we have gone too far in
this direction: pupils gain much discipline,
but little knowledge. What is the remedy?
Treatment that will yield discipline requires
time; hence, teach fewer topics and teach
them in detail, but emphasize the essentials.
Then by reviews drill upon the facts that
should be remembered. Discipline and
knowledge are the two sides of the shield
of history teaching.</p>

<p>“The Use and Abuse of Note Books”
was the subject of a paper thoroughly
worked out by Professor Albert H. Lybyer,
of Oberlin College. A well-balanced position
was maintained between the proper
use of note books as a means to certain
ends, and their abuse in the hands of pupils.
No more use of them was recommended
than could be properly supervised by the
teacher. There should be no note book requirement
in the grammar grades.</p>

<p>Not the least attractive of the topics presented
at this session was “The Value of
History Pageant Work from the Viewpoint
of the English Teacher,” by Miss Charity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Dye, of Indianapolis. Miss Dye’s conception
of the pageant is not that of a mere
exhibition; it should rather be the natural
expression of school interests and activities
that have been thoroughly worked out in a
serious way by students in various grades.
When so conducted, the school work that
precedes the presentation of a pageant has
many valuable features. It arouses the
spirit of investigation, when students hunt
out, organize, and build up historical materials;
it gives opportunity for the co-operation
of departments; it encourages in
pupils self-identification with school and
community interests; it cultivates imagination
and encourages continuity of thinking.
Pupils concentrate attention upon a
growing idea, and their work has cumulative
force. This preparation gives to
classes in English occasion for exercises in
narration, description, argument, and the
writing of letters, diaries, and ballads.
This is one method of overcoming the fragmentary
nature of our school work and
engaging in activities that are socially and
psychologically sound and beneficial.</p>

<p>The final topic of the program was “Supplementary
Reading in History Instruction,”
discussed by Professor Oscar H. Williams,
of the School of Education, Indiana University.
Many sensible and practical ideas
were presented. Professor Williams recommended
that striking passages from original
or secondary sources be copied and duplicated
by the mimeograph for class use;
that pupils be encouraged to bring to the
school magazines from which valuable articles
could be extracted and bound separately
in manila paper covers; that pupils be encouraged
to purchase for themselves certain
reference books, especially historical fiction.
It was especially urged that the best results
of collateral reading appear when
pupils become sufficiently interested to do
this work spontaneously.</p>

<p>In the business meeting preceding this
program, it was voted to accept the recommendation
of the executive committee, that
a special supplementary meeting of the
association be held in connection with meetings
of other associations interested in
history teaching at Indianapolis during the
meeting of the American Historical Association
next winter.</p>

<p>Professor James A. Woodburn was elected
president of the North Central Association
for the ensuing year, and Professor Earl W.
Dow was made vice-president. The association
loses the valuable services of its secretary-treasurer
of the past four years, Professor
George H. Gaston, of the Wendell
Phillips High School, Chicago; his place is
taken by Miss Mary L. Childs, of the
Evanston (Illinois) Township High School.
The following were elected members of the
executive committee: Dr. O. M. Dickinson,
Western Illinois Normal School, Macomb;
Professor W. E. Dodd, University of Chicago;
Miss Victoria Adams, Calumet High
School, Chicago; Miss Ellen G. Foster,
Evanston, Ill.</p>

<h3>NEW ENGLAND ASSOCIATION
MEETING.</h3>

<p>The annual spring meeting of the New
England Association was held in Boston
on Saturday, April 16, 1910, in the lecture
hall of the Boston Public Library. The
morning session was devoted to Roman history
and to the report of the Committee on
Historical Material. The opening address
was by Professor Henry A. Sill, of Cornell
University, who spoke on “Some New
Points of View in Roman History.” Just
one hundred years ago Niebuhr began the
epoch of modern critical historiography, and
for the first time applied the test of modern
criticism to the mass of tradition which
passed current as Roman history. Forty
years later Mommsen took up the task, and
in 1854 published his first volume. The
works of both writers were rapid and bold,
but they were works of genius and of intuition.
The speaker then considered certain
characteristics of Mommsen’s work,
among others specifying his comprehensiveness,
his thorough use of the sources, and
especially his modern tone. Mommsen did
not make direct references to modern politics,
but through indirect references sought
to make the Romans step down from their
pedestals and become real. We owe it to
Mommsen’s history that Rome does not
seem a land of fancy.</p>

<p>Although Mommsen made over one thousand
contributions with a total of more
than twenty thousand pages, he did not
speak the final word. Recently several
attempts have been made to sum up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
result of the numerous special investigations
which have been made since Mommsen’s
time, the speaker making mention of
Pais, Ferrero, and especially of Edouard
Meyer, whom he termed the master of
all. Of American writers Professor Botsford
has made a notable contribution in his
“Roman Assemblies.” Among the periods
of Roman history which are being rewritten
are the Foreign Wars, the history to the
fourth century B.C., and the Revolution.
Among the new points of view, Professor
Sill enumerated the influence of imperialism,
war and its effects on domestic policy,
sea-power, international arbitration, capitalism,
and added that we might even have
a pathological view of Roman history! In
conclusion, he cautioned against pushing
analogy too far.</p>

<p>Professor Sill’s paper was discussed
briefly by Professor H. B. Wright, of Yale
University, and Professor W. S. Ferguson,
of Harvard University, the latter citing an
interesting dissertation by a Roumanian
teacher on the nationality of the business
men of Rome and the light it threw on certain
problems of Roman history.</p>


<h4>Historical Material.</h4>

<p>An extensive exhibit of historical
material, comprising maps, charts, pictures,
casts, atlases and models had been procured
and displayed by a committee of the Association
consisting of Prof. Arthur I. Andrews,
of Simmons College, chairman; Prof. W. S.
Ferguson, Miss Ellen S. Davison, Mr. L. R.
Wells, Miss Mabelle Moses and Mr. W. H.
Cushing. In his brief report Professor
Andrews acknowledged the debt due Teachers’
College both for the idea and for many
models and pictures loaned for this exhibition.
The watchword of the committee has
been: “Show the attainable.” We have
aimed, said Professor Andrews, to place on
exhibition articles and samples of articles
that can, at a reasonable expense, be introduced
into any class-room. In addition to
the loans from Teachers’ College, much was
imported for the exhibition by Messrs. G.
Stechert &amp; Co.; other articles were loaned
by the publishers, and some were bought
outright by the Association. A special feature
of the exhibit was the large number of
the Hensell and Rausch models, probably
the largest collection ever displayed in this
country. As at the Teachers’ College exhibition,
one of the most helpful features
was the collection of mounted pictures illustrative
of various phases of life and conditions,
showing the possibilities in this line
where the expense is trifling. It is the intention
of the committee to prepare lists
of typical collections of maps, charts and
models costing twenty-five, fifty, one hundred,
two hundred and five hundred dollars.
After referring to the cost of various portions
of the exhibit, Professor Andrews
summed up as follows: “It will be seen,
then, that two things are fairly clear; first,
that a collection of the best material, up-to-date
in every way and including samples of
the best models, the best series of maps, the
latest charts, and the best pictures of every
kind, could be got together by this Association
at a very moderate cost; secondly, such
a collection, showing the exact cost of each
article, would be valuable to the teacher
who has a limited appropriation and who
needs to see for herself in the easiest possible
way just what she wants and just what
she can pay for.”</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of your committee has
been aroused by the contemplation of great
ideas as to the permanency of this collection.
We hope to arrange for the proper
housing of these exhibits, making it accessible
to teachers and classes visiting Boston,
and we also hope to arrange for transporting
it to other parts of New England where
it may be on exhibition in connection with
educational meetings. Undoubtedly it will
be a feature of the forthcoming meeting of
the N. E. A. in Boston in July.</p>

<p>Miss Ellen Scott Davison, of Bradford
Academy, spoke briefly on some practical
uses of pictures, and told of the practices
in German schools which she visited last
summer.</p>

<p>The guest of the Association at its luncheon
was General Edward Anderson, who
spoke most entertainingly of his recollections
of Lincoln, Grant, Sherman, John
Brown and other leaders and incidents of
the Civil War period. As President Evans
characterized it, it was the genuine source
method of instruction by an accomplished
speaker.</p>

<h3>COLLEGE CATALOGUE REQUIREMENTS
IN HISTORY.</h3>

<p>As a member of the Catalogue Committee
in one of our smaller colleges, it has
been my privilege the past two years to
study catalogues from all parts of the
country&mdash;perhaps sixty or more. Besides
the various general matters noticed, I have
naturally turned for information and help
to the history courses offered and to the
college entrance requirements in history.
This survey has given me several definite
impressions.</p>

<p>The requirements in history are generally
not organised as are the departments
of English, Latin and Mathematics. Frequently
they are not definite in their
statements as to just what they wish done.
One of our best northern colleges gives
four lines to History; over one page to
Science; over five pages to English.</p>

<p>Several colleges prepare their requirements
with care, although few are above
improvement. That is, one college will
enlarge on the text-books and supplementary
reading, but say nothing of the methods
of work; another will do just the
opposite. Among the best requirements
noticed in the South are those of the University
of Mississippi, the University of
the South, and Tulane University. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
most satisfactory one is from Leland Stanford
Junior University, which gives a
trifle over two pages, and includes both
books and methods. Probably half a page
would be more than the average length in
the catalogues examined.</p>

<p>Two articles in <span class="smcap">The History Teachers’
Magazine</span> for October, 1909, “Lessons
Drawn from the Papers of History Examination
Candidates,” by Miss Briggs, and
the editorial on “Method the Need,” have
stimulated thought. The following paragraphs
are offered as suggestions in one
direction.</p>

<p>It would seem that we might claim two
or three pages in the catalogue; they could
easily be filled. The following is one plan
that might be used:</p>

<p>The courses allowed as units.</p>

<p>[Then something like the following
which is adapted from the catalogue of
Leland Stanford Junior University.]</p>


<h4>Ancient History.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Text-Books</span><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;Goodspeed, “History of
the Ancient World” (Scribners); Morey,
“Outlines of Ancient History” (American
Book Co.); Myers, “Ancient History,”
Revised Edition (Ginn); West, “Ancient
World” (Allyn and Bacon); Wolfson,
“Essentials in Ancient History” (American
Book Co.); or an equivalent.</p>

<p>For supplementary reading and reference,
work in some of the following is suggested:
Botsford, “Story of Rome;” Cox, “General
History of Greece” (Student Series);
Fling, “Source Book of Greek History;”
Munro, “Source Book of Roman History;”
Pelham, “Outlines of Roman History;”
Shuckburgh, “History of Rome,” and Ginn
&amp; Co’s “Classical Atlas,” or Kiepert,
“Classical Atlas;” Tozer’s “Primer of
Classical Geography.”</p>

<p>This is carried out for the four groups.</p>

<p>Then give general suggestions at the end:
the work required of students in definite
statements; a few helps for the teachers
preparing students for the college, as
“Report of the Committee of Seven,”
<span class="smcap">History Teachers’ Magazine</span>, a few
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">syllabi</i> and <em>map books</em>.</p>

<p>Those suggestions may seem entirely
unnecessary to the colleges and universities
in the northeastern part of the country,
but they are greatly needed elsewhere, as
in many parts of the South where the high
school movement, though growing rapidly,
is yet in its formative period. Even with
the splendid school system of California
Stanford gives details, and I fancy such
help is needed in many of the smaller high
and private preparatory schools throughout
the country. Furthermore, if the best
known colleges and universities wish to
draw their students from all parts of the
country, they should make their requirements
so plain that they can be used in
any section.</p>

<h3>THE TOPICAL METHOD.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Editor History Teacher’s Magazine</span>:</p>

<p>The college entrance examination seems
to be a contest between the man who
makes out the questions and the teacher
who aims chiefly or solely to get his pupils
by the examination. The teacher who desires
mainly to teach history and how to
study it, and to whom the examination is
only an incident, is the “innocent third
party.” The examiner and the examination-crammer
alike search the papers of
previous years in the attempt to outwit
each other. It would never do to ask questions
only on the most important parts of
the subject; the candidates would surely
know all about such questions, a most undesirable
state of affairs! A teacher who,
perchance, would try to teach some of “the
glory that was Greece” and, to save time
for some first-hand acquaintance with
Greek literature cuts off the Peloponnesian
war with a single lesson may be doing
right, but his pupils may suffer when
asked to describe the Peloponnesian war
after the failure of the expedition to Syracuse.
He may dwell on the spread of Greek
civilization over the East, and his pupils be
asked to describe, with dates, Alexander’s
battles. He may emphasize the civilization
of the Empire and his pupils be examined
on the lives of insignificant emperors.</p>

<p>In mathematics the topics to be treated
in algebra are specified in detail; and a
syllabus of required or book propositions in
geometry is issued. In physics a list of
experiments is furnished. In English a
definite list of books for reading and another
for careful study are prescribed years
in advance.</p>

<p>It is in the air that certain objections to
the field of ancient history as stated by the
Committee of Seven will be met by providing
a list of topics representing the desirable
subjects for study in the pre-classical
and early medieval periods. Why not
go further and make it safe for a teacher
who would subordinate the passing of an
examination designed to beat the crammer,
to a sound knowledge of essentials and
substantial preparation in methods of historical
study? The worst that could happen
would be that an increasing number
of candidates would know the essentials
so well that most of them would pass good
examinations. But better still would be
the possibility of using the time thus
gained for a thorough and intensive study
of a very limited portion of the field,
whereby, to some degree, a right method of
historical study could be inculcated, thus
securing better work in history in college.</p>

<p>This plea is put forth not with a desire
to make easier the work of college preparation,
but from a feeling that the efforts
of the conscientious pupil and teacher
should reach out to a higher and more enduring
purpose than “beating the examiner.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
