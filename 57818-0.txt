Hart’s Essentials in American History

By ALBERT BUSHNELL HART, LL. D., Professor of History Harvard University

$1.50


The purpose of this volume is to present an adequate description of all
essential things in the upbuilding of the country, and to supplement
this by good illustrations and maps. Political geography, being the
background of all historical knowledge, is made a special topic, while
the development of government, foreign relations, the diplomatic
adjustment of controversies, and social and economic conditions,
have been duly emphasized. All sections of the Union, North, East,
South, West, and Far West, receive fair treatment. Much attention
is paid to the causes and results of our various wars, but only the
most significant battles and campaigns have been described. The book
aims to make distinct the character and public services of some great
Americans, brief accounts of whose lives are given in special sections
of the text. Towards the end a chapter sums up the services of America
to mankind.

HAZEN’S EUROPE SINCE 1815

By CHARLES D. HAZEN, Professor in Smith College

(_American Historical Series._) xxvi + 830 pp. 8vo. [_Ready in May._]

The aim has been to make the narrative so interesting in style as
to attract the student, without sacrificing accuracy or proportion.
For the sake of impressiveness it has been necessary to concentrate
attention upon a relatively small number of topics, but it is hoped
that no important step in the development of modern Europe has been
slighted. English history has been interwoven with continental history,
and colonial development has received careful treatment. Great pains
have been taken to make the bibliographical apparatus really useful to
the undergraduate.

_A NEW SCHOOL HISTORY_

A History of the United States

By S. E. FORMAN, PH.D., Author of “Advanced Civics,” etc.

Ready in May, 1910, and published by The Century Co.

◖ Teachers of American history, who are looking for the best text-book
for their classes, are invited to examine this new work of Dr.
Forman’s. They will find that it excels:

1 In the method of unfolding the story of OUR COUNTRY’S GROWTH

The pupils have before them the story of an ever-growing nation, and
step by step they follow its upbuilding from small beginnings to its
present great proportions.

2 In the special prominence given to the progress of THE WESTWARD
MOVEMENT

The story of the marvelous growth of the Middle West, and of the States
further West, is told, it is believed, with greater fullness than in
any previous school history. The student will see that the greatness
of our history is due as much to the Western States as to those on the
Atlantic seaboard.

3 In the treatment of THE BIOGRAPHICAL ELEMENT

The great leaders of our country stand out as real and interesting
personalities, because the author writes their lives into the main body
of the text.

4 In the account given of our COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL AND SOCIAL
DEVELOPMENT

Throughout the book frequent surveys are made of American civilization
as it existed at successive stages, and in these surveys the pupil
learns how we have passed from the simple life of the seventeenth
century to the complex life of to-day.

5 In the material provided for THE TEACHERS’ ASSISTANCE

At the end of the chapters are carefully framed questions on the text,
with review questions that keep constantly in mind the points that
have been gone over, and with topics for special reading and special
references. In the appendix are comprehensive outlines and analytical
reviews.

6 In the fullness and richness of ITS MAPS AND ILLUSTRATIONS

Entirely new maps have been made for the book, and the illustrations
have been selected from authentic sources. Many of the pictures are
illustrative of Western life in the early days.

7 In the CLEARNESS AND INTEREST OF ITS STYLE

No student can fail to be attracted by the manner in which the story
is told. The style is simple--sometimes almost colloquial--but never
undignified. Every paragraph in the book is interesting.

More than 400 pages, strongly bound in half leather. Price, $1.00 net.

Superintendents, teachers, and others interested are invited to send
for further particulars.

Freshman History Course at Yale


BY EDWARD L. DURFEE.

The scope and character of the elementary history course at Yale[1]
is determined by a twofold necessity: first, that of giving a general
survey of the main facts of historical development from the fall of
the Roman Empire to modern times which shall be valuable in itself and
profitable to the student, even though he were to pursue his historical
studies no further; and second, that of providing a course which will
fit into the general scheme of the history curriculum, and serve as an
introduction to the more advanced courses which follow it. According to
the present arrangement, the fields of English and American History are
reserved for succeeding years, and as a result, the Freshman course is
limited to the study of Continental European History, from 375 A.D. to
1870 or thereabouts.

Although I follow current local usage in speaking of this course as
“Freshman History,” the name is not strictly appropriate; it is open to
Sophomores, and even to upper classmen under certain limitations and
restrictions. The name by which it is known in the catalogue, History
A 1, better expresses the fact that it is the introductory course
which is a necessary preliminary to all the other history work. As a
matter of fact, the popular name is not seriously in error, for over
four-fifths of the students pursuing it are Freshmen.

The amount of time allotted to the study of the different epochs is
pretty evenly distributed. Beginning with a summary view of the Roman
Empire and an analysis of the causes of its decline, the work of the
first twelve weeks covers rather thoroughly the history of the Middle
Ages to 1250 A.D.; the Renaissance, Reformation, and Religious Wars
occupy the next third of the year; and the spring term has to suffice
for the period from Louis XIV to the Congress of Vienna. At that point,
the course practically ends, for the events of the nineteenth century
are sketched very briefly, partly because time is lacking, but more
particularly for the reason that a later and more advanced course
treats that period in detail.

Experience has convinced the instructors that any course, particularly
an introductory one, which deals in specious generalizations and
vague trends of development to the exclusion of a thorough drill in
concrete facts will, of necessity, be a failure; and so the methods of
instruction are designed, first of all, to secure an accurate knowledge
of events,--to make the student master the fundamental data upon which
any real comprehension of a great movement as a whole must be based.
Of course, this is equivalent to saying that we do not consider the
lecture method adapted to the immaturity of first year students,--even
the mixture of lecture and quiz recitations seems to offer too many
temptations to irregularity and slovenliness. Consequently, each of
our three exercises per week is devoted to a thorough test of the
student’s industry by oral questioning and, at frequent intervals, by
short written papers. The fact that the class is divided into small
divisions, averaging only twenty men in each, makes the desired end
comparatively easy of attainment.

In the matter of text-books, three or four are used, chosen for their
supplementary excellencies, and with the additional object in view
of developing in the student an elementary power of comparison and
synthesis,--an ability to select facts from different sources and
mould them into some sort of orderly cohesion for presentation in the
recitation. The proof that he has done this is sought, not only in the
recitation, but by inspection of his note-book, in which he is required
to keep a condensed but carefully arranged digest of the facts gleaned
from the various books.

As regards original sources, an experience lasting for a period of
six years has forced upon the unwilling minds of the instructors the
conviction that contemporary material, as a part of the required
reading, cannot be used to advantage in a general course, so broad in
scope as the one we are considering. The experiment was a thorough one
and long continued,--in fact, the feeling that we _ought_ to find a
profitable method of using sources lingered long after the proof had
been forced upon us that we could not, and it has produced no change in
the general opinion that such work is of the utmost value where time
is available to pursue it properly. But in this particular instance,
that was precisely what we could not do, at least not without entirely
changing the character of the course and modifying its relation to the
rest of the curriculum. Source collections are therefore no longer
among the required text-books, but are relegated to the domain of
collateral reading.

Unity and cohesion among the different instructors and the various
text-books is obtained by the use of a syllabus, blocked off into
lessons, each containing in addition to an outline and the necessary
assignments in the text-books, further references for reading in the
larger standard histories and biographies. Nor is historical geography
neglected, for each student must fill in with colors the successive
maps of an outline atlas.

Casual mention of collateral reading has already been made, but there
now remains to be described the method by which it is enforced and
directed,--a method which, I think, is unique and which, judged by its
results, would seem to be the most valuable feature of the course. In
the fall term, which is by far the hardest, owing to the Freshman’s
unfamiliarity with college methods of work and the difficult character
of the text-books used, little is done in this direction other than to
introduce him to the library, to point out to him the section in which
the books are to be found that are especially reserved for this course,
and to require him to do a fair amount of collateral reading upon some
specific subject, a clear outline of which he must insert in his note
book. But in the winter and spring terms a much more systematic and
thorough drill is undertaken, a brief description of which follows:

Some time in January or February a topic is assigned to each student,
comparatively restricted in its scope, chosen from the field of
medieval history up to and including the Renaissance. Within two or
three days, at a definitely appointed time, he meets his instructor in
a conference lasting from twenty minutes to half an hour, and submits a
list of books, magazine articles, essays, etc., which contain material
bearing upon his subject. This list is to be as complete as the student
can make it, and the first object of the conference is to discover
if he has exhausted the possibilities of the library,--to find out
whether he knows how to use the various catalogues, the more ordinary
aids such as Poole’s Index, the A. L. A. Index to General Literature,
etc., and whether he is familiar with the location of the reference
shelves and the stacks accessible to him. Satisfied upon these points,
the instructor selects from the list presented (and perhaps amended)
a number of chapters, articles, or books, as the case may require,
from which the student is to extract and collect in the form of notes
material for an essay on his particular subject. The remaining portion
of the conference period is occupied with describing and explaining to
the student just how these notes are to be taken.

The method of note taking is the most important matter in connection
with this first piece of work, for here, probably for the first time
in his life, the student is introduced to this particular application
of the card index and filing system. It is required that each note
be taken upon a separate card, that each card shall have a head line
appropriate for filing purposes, and that there be an accurate volume
and page reference to the book from which each bit of information was
taken. Emphasis is also put upon the fact that all the reading should
be done and all the notes completed before the essay is begun, and that
the essay should be written solely from the notes, without further
reference to the books; for experience has shown that this is the best
way of proving to the student himself whether his notes have been well
or poorly taken.

It may be urged that twenty or thirty minutes will not suffice for
thorough instruction in such a variety of matters; it certainly would
be impossible if it were not for the fact that the whole process is
simplified by providing each student in advance with a pamphlet which,
besides explaining briefly all these points, contains also a condensed
guide to the library. With the aid of this, the work of the instructor
is reduced to the task of ascertaining by well-directed questions just
what the student has done, and what he would do if he were confronted
with certain problems which are sure to arise. And of course, each
man is encouraged to consult the instructor informally at any time in
connection with puzzling points that may crop up.

As before, a definite time limit is set for this part of the work, and
at a second meeting, both the notes and the essay are handed in; and in
addition, directions are at that time given for the construction of a
formal bibliography. This differs from the preliminary book list which
was submitted at the beginning of the work in the following points: in
the first place, each book is to be properly and formally listed on a
separate card; secondly, reference must be made on each card, not only
to the pages which deal with the student’s particular topic, but to
those where further bibliographical lists are to be found; again, he is
at this time introduced to and taught to use the principal historical
bibliographies, and required to enter on cards those which give lists
of books on his subject, with an exact reference to the pages where
these lists are to be found, without, however, copying any titles from
these lists; and lastly, he must make an elementary classification of
all his cards by dividing them into three groups,--bibliographies,
sources and secondary works.

In the spring term the process is repeated with each student, certain
modifications being introduced, however, which constitute steps in
advance and prevent the men from viewing the second piece of work as
a monotonous repetition of the first. For instance, the subject is
chosen from the modern period; while the notes and essay are done in
the same manner, a longer time is allowed, and, on the basis of a sharp
criticism of his first theme, much improvement in these respects is
expected; and the character of the bibliography is entirely changed.

The primary object of the first bibliography, it will be noticed, was
to teach the student how to find _all_ the books on his subject, how to
use the library, catalogues, bibliographies, etc. In the case of the
second, we endeavor to teach him how to find the _best books_; in other
words, we require a selected and critical bibliography, and insist that
no book be entered unless its card bears a statement of its comparative
value by some recognized authority. To secure such statements the
student must, of course, in addition to using the usual bibliographies
critically and selectively, search for book reviews in the various
reputable magazines, historical and otherwise. As an additional
incentive, a prize, named for the Hon. Andrew D. White, is awarded to
the author of the best piece of work.

This system was evolved from tentative experiments lasting three
years, and has now been in operation, in its present form, for three
more; and it seems to be the opinion of competent judges that it is
an unqualified success. In the first place, it teaches the student a
great deal, not only about particular phases of European history, but
more especially about methods of work which will stand him in good
stead in all his future courses; and while it demands much of him, the
requirements are all so carefully graded and the work so progressive
in character that at no time is he overwhelmed by the amount suddenly
thrust upon him. And another feature that deserves emphasis is the
care taken to prevent each man from slighting any part of the process;
during the time he is at work on his two themes he must meet his
instructor in no less than five personal consultations which punctuate
at carefully chosen times the various stages of the work.

The obvious difficulty that the system demands too much of the
instructor is met by the fact that the History Department, as well
as the whole Faculty, have shown their appreciation of the results
obtained by lightening the ordinary work of teaching to an extent that
permits the teacher to carry this extra burden without undue effort.




THE WRITINGS OF WILLIAM PENN.


An interesting announcement has been made by Albert Cook Myers, of
Moylan, Pa., concerning a plan for the publication of the complete
works of William Penn. It is noteworthy that there is no edition of
Penn’s works which is nearly complete. The fullest edition, that of
1726, is difficult to obtain. The later editions of 1771, 1782 and 1823
contain but a small portion of his works. Yet even the first edition
contains but twenty per cent. of the works which were published during
Penn’s lifetime. Of the eleven hundred known letters of Penn only one
hundred and twenty-five have ever been printed. The aim of Mr. Myers is
to obtain a guarantee from members of the Society of Friends and others
of a fund amounting to $18,000, which will be sufficient to defray
the expense incident to making such a collection. A committee of the
Historical Society of Pennsylvania has been appointed to co-operate
with Mr. Myers in this publication. The committee includes Hon. Samuel
W. Pennypacker, William Brooke Rawle, Charlemagne Tower, John Bach
McMaster, Isaac Sharpless, William I. Hull, and William Penn-Gaskell
Hall. Persons willing to assist in this work either by the contribution
of funds or by the loaning of manuscripts are requested to correspond
with Mr. Myers.

furnished by the Middle Ages or the Renaissance period, none is more
interesting and few more complete than the accompanying illustration
from the “Margarita Philosophica” of Gregorovius de Reisch (or George
Reisch).

Reisch was prior of the Carthusian monastery at Freiburg and confessor
of the Emperor Maximilian I. Noted for his learning, he published one
of the briefest, but also one of the most popular of the numerous
cyclopedias of learning produced during the late mediæval and early
modern centuries. This work, the “Margarita Philosophica,” first
appeared at Heidelberg in 1496, and went through numerous editions,
eight of them appearing by 1535. While the substance of the work was
mediæval, it was tinged by the dawning modern spirit, as is shown by
the title and by a consciousness of the significance of the Renaissance
period by the claim set forth in the title to the incorporation of
additions to “all known things.” The full title reads: The “Margarita
Philosophica,” or the “Philosophical Pearl: treating of all known
things; with additions, such as are to be found nowhere else.”
(_Aepitoma Omnis Phylosophiae, Alias Margarita Phylosophica Tractans de
omni genere scibili: Cum additionibus: Que in alijs non habentur._)

The first seven books treat of the seven liberal arts, the eighth and
ninth of natural phenomena; the tenth, eleventh and the twelfth of
the soul. These twelve books are divided into 573 chapters containing
an epitome of the knowledge of the day. Much of the value of the
work to present day students depends upon the numerous illustrations
of symbolic character. One of the most important of these is the
accompanying Tower of Knowledge, which gives the whole scheme of
education of that period.

The youthful victim is admitted to the Tower by the Muse of Wisdom, who
presents to him the horn book. Once admitted he begins the toilsome
progress through various chambers of the tower which correspond to the
twelve books of the treatise, namely, the first eight to the seven
liberal arts, grammar being given, not only two chambers but two entire
floors. The first chamber is devoted to Donatus, whose “Eight parts of
speech,” written about 400 A.D., formed the traditional approach to all
studies for many centuries. So nearly universal was the use of this
part of Donatus’ larger work on grammar, that the term _donat_ came
into frequent use as a synonym for an introduction into any subject.
Donatus continued very popular into the 16th or even 17th century,
though its popularity was successfully contested by many later works,
especially that of Alexander de Villa Dei of the 13th century.

The second chamber is devoted to Priscian, whose more elaborate work
on grammar (from about 526 A.D.) formed the source of much of the
common literary knowledge of the middle ages. Priscian was one of the
works most frequently issued from the early press, and yet exists in
more than a thousand manuscripts. In all Priscian quotes more than 250
authors, several of them more than 100 times, the “Æneid” of Vergil
more than seven hundred times. Thus the study of Latin grammar was
of far greater significance than the modern conception of the term
indicates and justifies to Reisch the assignment of two floors of the
Tower.

From the study of grammar the youth proceeds to the study of rhetoric
and poetry, the middle one of the three rooms of the third floor.
Cicero is here the presiding genius. From rhetoric the student proceeds
to the logic of Aristotle, thus completing the trivium.

The first subject of the _quadrivium_ is arithmetic, represented by
Boethius. The remaining three subjects of the quadrivium form the
fourth floor. These are astronomy, represented by Ptolemy; geometry, by
Euclid, and music by Pythagoras.

Following the quadrivium come the subjects which no doubt represent
“the additions to known things” in the mind of the compiler. These are
the physical sciences, typified by Pythagoras, and Moral Philosophy,
by Seneca. Crowning all comes the study of theology and metaphysics,
represented by Peter the Lombard, whose “Sentences” had been the
orthodox theological text now for two centuries.

The symbolic illustrations which accompany the book of the treatise
on these several subjects are of no less interest than the tower of
knowledge itself; for these go into great detail in exposition of the
aim and characteristic features of each study. Such illustrations
present in a concrete way the curricula and the methods of school work
in the past.




Recent History

The Situation in Great Britain


BY JOHN HAYNES, PH.D., DORCHESTER HIGH SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS.

In the last article of this series it was stated that the rejection
by the House of Lords of the Budget of 1909 brought before the
British people not only a fundamental question of taxation, but the
constitutional question of the position of the Upper House. For
centuries it had been generally conceded that the authority over
finance belonged exclusively to the House of Commons. But the Lords
in 1909, claiming that the new proposals were revolutionary, passed a
resolution respecting the budget, “that this House is not justified
in giving its consent to this bill until it has been submitted to the
judgment of the country.” The Commons answered by another resolution
that this action was “a breach of the Constitution and a usurpation
of the rights of the Commons.” Nevertheless it was necessary for
the ministry to dissolve Parliament in January 1910, and carry the
issue before the voters. In the campaign the Liberals stood for the
budget, the denial of the right of the Lords to reject it, and home
rule for Ireland. The Labor party, in addition to supporting the views
of organized labor on questions affecting working men, were strongly
in favor of the budget. The Irish Nationalists, as always, put Irish
home rule before everything else. The Conservatives, under the name of
Unionists, which they use to emphasize their opposition to home rule,
made their campaign chiefly on the issue of “tariff reform,” which in
Great Britain means the abandonment of her free trade policy. Sentiment
in favor of doing this has greatly increased in recent years, and those
who favor it are supplied with much greater financial resources for
pushing their views than those who uphold the present policy. It would
not surprise the present writer to see Great Britain return to the
“protective” system, though he believes it would be a misfortune of the
greatest magnitude to the British people.

The resolution passed by the Lords when they rejected the budget
implied that an election would be in the nature of a referendum, and so
it was to a certain extent, but it was a very imperfect one. The law
which permits plural voting was, as always, a great disadvantage to the
Liberals, and undoubtedly lost them several seats. Again, there has
been no distribution of seats since 1885, and the present arrangement
is grossly inequitable. As an extreme example the member from Romford
represents over seventeen times as many voters as the member from
Whitehaven. The Liberals and Labor party are the ones who suffer from
this condition. Ireland, whose representation is wholly Nationalist
and Conservative, has one-fourth more members of Parliament than she
is justly entitled to. Another thing which helped the Conservatives
were “three-cornered contests” which gave them at least five seats
as representatives of districts where the Liberal and Labor voters
together far outnumbered the Conservatives. Then, again, the question
was so confused with other matters that there was not a direct issue on
the budget. Doubtless many free traders voted for Unionist candidates
from opposition to Irish home rule or the policy of the Liberals on
the school and liquor questions. It is the misfortune of the Liberals
that their progressive policies at the same time encounter the
three powerful interests represented by the landholders, the liquor
dealers, and the Anglican Church. In Ireland the home rule question
so overshadowed all others that there was no expression whatever of
popular opinion on the budget, though enough is known to make it pretty
certain that the majority would be against it. In England, Wales and
Scotland, the popular majority of the Liberals and Laborites combined in
spite of plural voting, was nearly three hundred thousand. It may be
concluded that notwithstanding the growth of sentiment adverse to free
trade the Lloyd-George budget would be adopted by a safe margin if it
were submitted as a simple question to the British people. The actual
result was the choice of 274 Liberals, 273 Conservatives, 82 Irish
Nationalists and 41 Labor members, a situation which gives the Irish
Nationalists under the leadership of John Redmond the balance of power.

The new Parliament met February 15th. The King’s speech was very brief
and foreshadowed the re-introduction of the budget and proposals for
giving the House of Commons undivided authority over finance and
preponderance in all legislation. This speech from the throne contained
the altogether unusual phrase “in the opinion of my advisers.” The
motion of the Unionists to amend the King’s speech by inserting a
resolution in favor of “tariff reform” was defeated by the votes of the
Liberals and Laborites, the Irish Nationalists abstaining from voting.
From the opening of Parliament till the 24th of March the time has been
occupied with necessary routine work, but it has become evident from
the attitude of Mr. Redmond and the more radical supporters of the
ministry that the question of curbing the power of the Lords must take
precedence of the consideration of the budget. If the Nationalists are
satisfied by the action of the ministry on this question the budget
will probably pass the Commons, the Irish members either voting for it
or abstaining from voting.

For the present, the question of the power of the House of Lords has
become paramount. It is recognized even by the Conservatives that the
present situation is indefensible. The fact that the membership of
the House of Lords is overwhelmingly conservative leads to what is
practically a government by a single chamber when the Conservatives are
in the majority in the Commons. It has been possible for Conservative
ministries to put through measures, like the Education Act of 1902,
which have never been submitted to the country and would probably not
be approved if submitted. On the other hand when the Liberals are in
power the Lords by rejecting and mutilating legislation have prevented
the principal Liberal measures from becoming law. The only recourse of
the Liberals would be to appeal to the country on every question of any
importance. March 23d the House of Lords by a vote of 175 to 17 adopted
a set of resolutions introduced by Lord Rosebery, which are likely to
become the Conservative platform on the question. They are: “First,
that a strong and efficient Second Chamber is not merely an integral
part of the British Constitution, but is necessary to the well-being of
the State and the balance of Parliament.

“Second, that a strong and efficient Second Chamber can best be
obtained by the reform and reconstruction of the House of Lords.

“Third, that a necessary preliminary to such reform and reconstruction
is the acceptance of the principle that the possession of a peerage
should no longer itself give the right to sit and vote in the House of
Lords.”

It will be noticed that this resolution is non-committal on the
question of how the voting members shall be chosen. The suggestions
which have found their way into print are that the Peers should choose
a certain part of their own number, that county councils should elect,
that learned societies should be represented, and that men who had held
high posts should be voting members. It has been stated that there
would be a number of life peers. The proposal is very indefinite, and
furnishes no guarantee on the most necessary point, namely, that the
Second Chamber must be one which will not forever defeat the measures
of the Liberals when they have a majority of the Commons. It would seem
that the only logical position of those who favor a strong upper house
would be to have it elected from larger districts and for longer terms
than the House of Commons.

The Liberals, however, have not adopted such a plan. On March 22d,
Prime Minister Asquith gave notice of three resolutions which will
probably for some time or until carried out constitute the platform of
the Liberals and their allies. The first declares it expedient that the
House of Lords be disabled by law from rejecting any money bill. The
second that it is expedient that the powers of the House of Lords over
other bills be restricted so that any such bill which has passed the
House of Commons for three successive sessions and has been rejected by
the House of Lords in each of these sessions shall become a law without
the consent of the House of Lords provided that not less than two years
have elapsed between the introduction of a bill and its becoming law.
The third resolution proposes to limit the duration of each Parliament
to five years. These proposals possess the advantage of definiteness
which the Rosebery resolutions lack. They are obviously open to the
charge of proposing a one-chambered government. Late dispatches seem
to indicate that these resolutions have been approved by the leaders
of the Nationalists and Laborites, and that at no distant day Premier
Asquith will again go to the country with these propositions instead of
the budget as the chief issue, for the resolutions are certain to be
rejected by the Lords.

In the interval between the preparation of this article (March 28th)
and its publication, it is probable that events will move rapidly in
Great Britain, but the writer hopes that this and the preceding article
on the budget will furnish in brief form a useful historical background
for such events as may take place.

European History in the Secondary School


D. C. KNOWLTON, PH.D. Editor.

THE UNIFICATION OF ITALY.


Italy in Its Relation to Europe.

The history of the unification of Italy is so closely connected with
developments outside the peninsula that it is difficult to make the
details of the story intelligible, and at the same time preserve the
proper European perspective. In order to link together the various
episodes which mark the appearance of this new state, the teacher must,
of necessity, direct the attention of the class to ground already
traversed, besides anticipating in a measure certain events which call
for fuller treatment later. There is, then, an unparalleled opportunity
for review; but a very real difficulty arises when the instructor
has occasion to refer to such events as the Six Weeks’ War or the
Franco-Prussian War, which have not yet been taken up in their European
setting. In view of these problems it might be advisable to review some
of these details after the story of German unification has been told,
making the year 1871 an occasion for a retrospect of the history of
the preceding quarter of a century. In this way the importance of this
period may be brought home forcibly to the class. “With the Crimean
War began a period of wars and territorial changes. In sixteen years
there were four European wars between great powers, not to mention the
local wars in Italy and Denmark; all central Europe was rearranged.”
(Seignobos, p. 787.) “Indeed the changes made in the map of Europe
between 1850 and 1871 were in some respects greater than the final
results of the warfare which ended in that great pacification.” (The
reference here is to the Congress of Vienna.)[2]


The Central Theme.

The main points which call for emphasis at the hands of the instructor
have been summed up by Seignobos in the following statement: “The
union of Italy was accomplished by all the Italian advocates of unity,
royalists and republicans, working in harmony with the Piedmontese
government, aided by a great European power, first France, then Prussia
(p. 351).” Possibly additional interest may be aroused by suggesting
the thought that here was the unusual spectacle of a nation made one,
“not by conquest, but by consent.” This idea may be brought out best by
comparison.


Obstacles to Union.

The chief obstacles to a union of the various states of Italy
afford a proper introduction to the story. The most important of
these was undoubtedly the presence of the foreigner. Italy had long
been “a geographical expression,” controlled in the interest of an
extra-Italian power. Dismemberment was its normal condition. A series
of maps might be prepared to illustrate this fact, using a vivid color
to indicate the territory controlled, first by Spain, then by Austria,
then by France, and again by Austria, according to the arrangements
made at Vienna. The following subjects are suggested:

(1) The Spanish Hegemony; (2) Beginning of Austria’s power in Italy
(1715); (3) Restoration of Spain’s power in Italy, including the
Austrian possessions in the peninsula (1735); (4) Italy in the time of
Napoleon (1810); and (5) Power of Austria in Italy after the Congress
of Vienna, showing the Sardinian territories (1815). These maps will
serve the purpose best if not over three colors are used in their
construction. The atlases of Dow and Putzger, and such text-books as
Robinson and West will supply the necessary details. The constant
reappearance on each of these maps of a black band stretching across
the peninsula will serve to emphasize the importance of another
hindrance to Italian unity, namely, the temporal power of the papacy.


Italy After the Revolution of 1848.

The discussion of Italian politics from 1815 to 1840 will be determined
in part by the plan which the teacher has adopted for the treatment
of this period in its general European aspect. Whatever line of
treatment has been pursued, 1840 marks the real point of departure for
presenting the facts connected with the formation of the kingdom of
Italy. This date affords an opportunity for summing up the condition
of the peninsula and for pointing out some of the lessons taught by
the February Revolution. The next ten years constitute “the period of
preparation.” Ten more were consumed before the hopes of the advocates
of unity had been fully realized--if indeed they can be said to have
been altogether realized. One of the first problems confronting the
makers of modern Italy was the welding together of the widely scattered
territories, occupied by diversified elements and possessing but few
interests in common, which were known as the kingdom of Sardinia.
(Read Seignobos, p. 346.) If Sardinia was to lead in the movement for
unity and independence she must be thoroughly organized and prepared
to assume the financial and military burdens involved. Not the least
of her problems was that of “convincing all Italian Liberals that she
could be trusted;” that she was their Heaven-sent leader. The task was
all the more difficult because of the humiliation she had so recently
undergone at the hands of Austria. Piedmont, however, had “failed
heroically,” and, in spite of Novara, still remained “the center of
nationalist hopes.” Two things were patent to the keen student of
affairs, first, that Sardinia alone could not drive out the foreigner,
and second, that any attempt at union must not be imperiled in the
future by differences of opinion as to the nature thereof.


The Great Personalities.

Four great personalities fill the period from 1840 to 1860--“each
was complementary in his life work to the other”--Mazzini, Cavour,
Garibaldi, and behind them all, displaying rare wisdom and common sense
at every crisis, the warrior king, Victor Emmanuel II. Mazzini has
been called the Prophet of Italian unity; Cavour, its Statesman; and
Garibaldi, its Knight-Errant. Of these three, Mazzini is most difficult
to understand. The secondary student will find it next to impossible
to enter into the far-reaching, although somewhat Utopian, schemes of
this great Italian publicist. It is enough perhaps to point out how, by
organizing Young Italy, he created the necessary enthusiasm among his
countrymen to make possible the work of Cavour and Garibaldi.

Neither is Cavour’s public career devoid of difficulties. The attention
of the class should be confined here to his efforts to place Sardinia
on a sound economic basis, and at the same time secure for her the
support and friendship of the great powers of Europe. The ambitions
of Napoleon III, who dominated European politics prior to 1870, were
utilized by the great state-maker in the furtherance of these plans.
(See also Cesaresco, Cavour, Preface, for an outline of the policy of
Cavour.)


The Attainment of Unity.

When the “epoch of realization” (1859-1870) has been reached, several
plans are open to the instructor for presenting the various steps in
the process of state-making. Beginning with the Crimean War, it is
possible to associate the various acquisitions of territory with the
wars which fill the period, namely, the Austro-Sardinian War, the
Six Weeks’ War and the Franco-Prussian struggle; or to deal with the
successive additions of territory as such, emphasizing the date and
circumstances attending each. (See Seignobos, p. 351.) In the first
case, emphasis is placed on the means employed; in the second, on the
end attained. In either case reference should be made to the eagerness
of the people to join with Sardinia, as shown in the plebiscites. If
the second plan be followed, it will be easier to introduce Garibaldi.
The episode of the Thousand offers material for an interesting report.
In this connection mention might be made of a recent work by G. M.
Trevelyan, Garibaldi and the Thousand.


Literature.

Out of the great mass of material on this subject mention might be made
of the following: Seignobos, Europe since 1814, Chaps. XI and XXVII
(one of the best accounts); Judson, Europe in the Nineteenth Century,
Part II, Chap. X, and Part III, Chap. XIV (clear and interesting);
Phillips, Modern Europe, Chap. XV; Cesaresco, Liberation of Italy;
Cesaresco, Cavour; and Stillman, Union of Italy, 1815-1895. The two
authors last mentioned represent somewhat different points of view. The
Countess Cesaresco waxes eloquent as she unfolds her story. Stillman is
inclined to take a less roseate view of the manner and means whereby
Italy won her place among the nations. Marriott, “Makers of Modern
Italy,” will also be found very helpful and suggestive. The list might
be increased materially, but the books which have been cited will not
only be found helpful, but may readily be secured from most libraries.

Ancient History in the Secondary School


WILLIAM FAIRLEY, Ph.D., Editor.


Choice of Material.

There remain to us but two of these studies of the Roman world; but
two short months of school in which to cover tragic centuries of
European development. A stern self-restraint in the choice of topics to
be treated is necessary therefore, both for the articles and for the
school. The welter of detail is all but overwhelming; and the teacher
must select a few salient features of these eight centuries. For the
present month we may consider what is worth while down to the so-called
“fall of Rome.”


The Two Good Centuries.

From the time when the new empire settled down into peace under
Augustus to the death of Marcus Aurelius in 180 A.D. there came a
period, when, as has been well said, the Mediterranean basin was
probably more prosperous, more happy and better governed than at any
time before or since. This is not always understood and accepted. The
evil side of Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, Domitian, the turmoil under
Galba and his two successors, have been unduly emphasized. Probably
there has been too much “muck-raking” even by eminent historians. Under
the worst of the rulers named it is to be remembered that tyranny and
cruelty were almost totally confined to the capital and its cliques.
The provinces were on the whole well administered, especially in
comparison with the corruption of later republican times. Within this
period, too, fall the Golden and the Silver Ages of Roman literature.


The Disastrous Third Century.

From Marcus Aurelius to Diocletian stretches an evil century. The
rocks upon which Rome was finally to be shipwrecked began to show
their heads. Government again became a prey instead of a service. The
“barrack emperors”--“the thirty tyrants” cursed the imperial chair. The
German barbarians began to press hard upon the borders of the empire.
Pestilence, imported from the East, thinned the already weakened
population. The army came to be almost wholly recruited, and in a
large degree officered by Germans. It was almost as if Great Britain
depended solely for her defense upon Hindoo troops, for lack of men
and mettle among the English themselves. Then came the spasm of reform
under Aurelian. And meantime the barbarians by scores of thousands at
first, and soon by hundreds of thousands, came drifting down from the
north and east. Their comings were quiet enough at the first. They
simply moved in where Romans had largely died out. We might compare it
in some ways to what would happen if our country should allow a free
immigration of Orientals into our Pacific slope.


Reorganization.

The fourth century saw the great reforms under Diocletian and
Constantine. The empire was reorganized and, for the time being,
strengthened. But the new vigor was vicious in type. It was oriental
despotism thinly disguised, as shown by the strange new garb of the
emperors, no longer great generals and first citizens; and by the
horde of office-holders with novel, high-sounding titles fitted to the
various grades of the new bureaucracy.

A line of cleavage was developed by the establishment of the double
capital and the joint emperors. East and West began to separate. The
division was in part dictated by the difficulty of administering
the vast empire from one center in a period when communication was
incredibly slow as compared with our modern facilities of steam and
electricity. And in this division was a double seed. From one kernel
was to spring disaster for Italy and the West. From the other was to
germinate the Eastern Empire, destined to be the fortunate and stupid
conservator of culture and learning throughout the dark ages.


Christianity.

With the fourth century the Christian faith began to assert itself as
never before. Its persecution, off and on, for three centuries, and its
triumph need a little study. Why was it that the Roman system could
tolerate the excesses of the licentious Eleusinian and Bacchic orgies
and the foul superstitions of Egypt, but could find no charity for a
pure and gentle faith? Because Christianity was itself righteously
intolerant. Very early in the history of the empire it became the
fashion and then the law that the genius of the emperor should be
adored. To the already polytheistic citizen of the empire this was no
added hardship. One god more made no difference to him, and the cynical
Roman magistrate could not understand why the wretched Christian was so
stubborn about a pinch of incense in honor of the emperor. It meant so
little to him religiously--but everything to the Christian. And so the
Christians died by thousands. Yet the persecuted faith spread apace,
drawing into its fold of hope and inward peace the wayworn travelers
upon the cruel road of life in those weary years. Then came the
conversion of Constantine and the gradual disintegration of paganism.
For a study of the brighter side of pagan life and a proof that the
whole Roman world, as so often taught, was not thoroughly rotten, read
Pater’s “Marius, the Epicurean,” and Dill’s “Roman life in the Fourth
Century.”


The Barbarians.

It is surprising to the judicious what can be the effect of a word or
phrase. Probably the term “barbarian” has caused as much confusion in
the minds of young students of history as any other term. It signifies
to him at least a semi-savage. Yet we know that to the Greek it meant
only a non-Hellene. In the later Roman times it meant Goth or German.
And yet, long before these people finally disrupted the Western Empire,
they had ceased to be barbarian in any common conception of the term.
If we substitute for the word migration the longer word immigration,
it will give a better idea of their earlier comings, to which allusion
has already been made. Humbler neighbors from without the pale, they
slowly crept into the southern space and glow out of their crowded
and unlovely north. With no ideas of conquest at first, but seeking
betterment for themselves, as to-day come the peoples from the same
Russia; or, pressed out of their own hunting grounds by the atrocious
Hun, they poured steadily in. And long before they became a menace,
most of them had become at least half civilized by contact with the
finer south. Their men had many of them served in the Roman legions.
And Christianity had early made way among them. And at length, when
the weakness of the West made it an easy prey to their greater vigor,
it was not as bands of whooping savages falling upon a peaceful white
settlement that they came, but they simply took up the scepter of
destiny which nerveless and unworthy hands had let fall. Emerton’s
“Introduction to the Middle Ages,” and the early chapters of Adams’
“Civilization during the Middle Ages,” furnish the best of reading for
topics like these just suggested.


The Fall of Rome.

There never was such a thing. That is putting it bluntly. But no
contemporary historian uses such a phrase. It is another of the fables
of history which need correction. To the Italian the sending of the
imperial insignia from Rome to Constantinople meant no more than the
Rhode Islander understood when Newport ceased to be one of the capitals
of his State. There was no longer need for an emperor at Rome; that was
all. The Goth who was in control there had been so for a generation,
and considered himself just as good a subject of the emperor at
Constantinople after the deposition of Augustus as he had been before.

In teaching children it will be hard to treat the subject in the way
just indicated. Probably a little analysis of the causes of this “fall
of Rome” will seem logically necessary. Some such outline as the
following might be tolerated. But let the teacher bear in mind that no
historian has yet succeeded in giving such a set of reasons for this
fall as will satisfy any other historian. The child mind, however, is
not critical, and may be helped by a catalogue of forces.

A. As political causes:

Failure to govern justly.

Growth of militarism.

Lack of home rule, and of representation.

The administrative division of the empire.

B. As social and economic causes:

Steady decline in population, resulting from vice, war, pestilence and
Christian asceticism.

Slavery, as depicted in the preceding article, and now grown still more
dreadful.

Taxation, so oppressive that a Christian writer says there were more
collectors than payers of taxes.

C. As military causes:

The cessation of military service by Italians and the use of Germanic
soldiers.

D. As moral and religious causes:

The vice fostered by a corrupt court.

The general decline of morals among a weakened and disheartened people.

Over against all these are to be set the numbers, the virility, the
comparative freedom from civilized vices, of the sturdy barbarians; and
most of all their capacity for absorbing the worthiest things among the
people whom they conquered.




American History in the Secondary School


ARTHUR M. WOLFSON, PH.D., Editor.

RECENT AMERICAN HISTORY.


The New Era.

By the year 1876 or 1877, the period of Reconstruction may be said
to have come to an end. From that time on the people of the United
States were busy developing new ideas and attempting to settle new
problems. Only gradually, however, did they recognize this fact; not
till the end of the nineteenth century did the country awake to a full
realization that the old order was no more, that a new order had come
into existence. Just because this new order has been so recently born,
however, because so many of its elements are so imperfectly understood,
the teacher will probably find special difficulties in teaching it to
his classes.


The Age of Extra-Continental Expansion and of New Economic Development.

To begin with, the student must be taught that this last generation in
America has witnessed two almost entirely new developments: (1) the
extra-continental expansion of the United States, and (2) the growth of
enormous combinations of labor and of capital. The first reached its
climax in the Spanish-American War, the acquisition of the Philippines
and of Porto Rico, the assumption of a quasi-protectorate over the
republics of Central America, and the interference in the affairs of
China and Japan. With the details of this movement we shall not attempt
to deal in this article. Instead we shall devote all of our space to a
consideration of the second series of events.

The history and the results of the growth of these large combinations
of labor and of capital present themselves in three more or less
distinct phases: (a) the struggle of the laborer for his full share
in the distribution of wealth; (b) the development of capitalistic
enterprise through the large corporations; and (c) the effort of the
consumer to keep from being crushed by the weight of the two contending
forces.

Though the interest of the consumer in these new economic problems is
destined, in the opinion of many students, to become the paramount one,
up to the present time it has received but little direct attention
from constructive statesmen, and it does not, therefore, properly
belong among the subjects to be discussed in the history class room.
The teacher may, nevertheless, call the attention of his students to
the evidences of the beginning of the definite movement to protect the
interests of the consumer: the recent Pure Food Acts, the legislation
of the various states designed to limit the profits of railway and
other public service corporations, and the widespread agitation of the
present day over the high cost of living.


The Labor Problem.

In studying the labor problem, our investigations must begin as far
back as the middle of the last century when the first trade unions
were organized in the United States. Since then they have grown
steadily till to-day they number their members in the millions. In the
beginning, these unions were limited to one locality and to men who
were working in the same trade; gradually, however, they broadened
their scope till they became national in their limits and universal in
the class of workmen who were eligible to membership. In presenting the
movement, it will be well for the teacher to select some thoroughly
typical trade union, such as the Brotherhood of Railway Engineers, some
thoroughly typical amalgamated union, such as the American Federation
of Labor, for purposes of illustration. To get the class to investigate
the history of these unions as far as possible, and to confine the
discussion to their activities will be the teacher’s duty, else the
study will result in hopeless confusion.

The principal weapons of the unions have been the strike and the
boycott. The history of the use of both of these should be followed
briefly. Then should come the consideration of the counterblast which
the corporations and the consumer have recently called to their aid:
the judicial injunction (study the history of the Debs case and the
more recent Bucks Stove Case), and the application of the Sherman
Anti-Trust Act of 1890 to the labor unions as associations in restraint
of trade (study the Danbury Hatters’ Case, in which the decision of the
Court was issued only a few months ago).


The Railroad Problem.

In studying the history of the large corporations, it pays in the
beginning to indicate clearly the difference between (1) public service
corporations, those which enjoy partial or complete monopoly under
franchises granted by the government, and (2) industrial corporations,
whose operations do not differ essentially from the enterprises of
single individuals, except in the amount of capital which they command.
Public service corporations may again be divided into two classes: (1)
the interstate railroads, and (2) those corporations whose business is
local in its nature, such as the street railroad, the water companies
and the gas companies.

Attacking the problem of the interstate railroads first, the class
must begin its work by studying the history of the growth of the great
trunk lines, like the New York Central and the Pennsylvania, and of the
transcontinental railroads, like the Union Pacific and the Northern
Pacific. Next in order will come the story of the vicious practices
which grew out of the excessive competition among these railroads:
rate wars, unfair discriminations against localities and against
individual shippers, overcapitalization, etc.

Early in the ’80’s the railroads themselves attempted to remedy these
evils by forming the famous pooling associations, but these pooling
associations were later prohibited by law. Next the individual states
attempted to improve conditions by passing special railroad codes
and by creating state railroad commissions. Finally, in 1887, the
national government, by the Interstate Commerce Act attempted to better
conditions, but improvement came but slowly. Since then, by numerous
Court decisions, the most important of which was the decision in
the Northern Securities Case, and by at least two amendments to the
Interstate Commerce Act, the Elkins Act of 1903 and the Hepburn Act of
1907, the national government has attempted to improve the situation.
Conditions to-day are much better than they have ever been in the past,
but there is still room for much improvement.


Municipal Public Service Corporations.

In discussing local public service corporations, it is well for the
teacher to develop in the beginning the fact that there are two
possible ways of dealing with them: (1) municipal ownership, and (2)
state regulation. Even in this country the first method has been
tried to some extent; most of our largest cities now own their own
water supply, and some of them are in possession of their own gas and
electric light plants. Thus far, however, most American states and
cities have been content to confine their activities in dealing with
public service corporation to regulating their functions and privileges
by special legislation and by establishing special commissions. Still,
the history of the regulation of public service corporations in this
country is as yet in its beginnings; the teacher can therefore go but
little farther than to set his students thinking upon the question as
to which is the better method of dealing with the problem.


Industrial Corporations.

Like the trunk lines and the transcontinental railroads, the great
industrial corporations had their origin in the years following the
period of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Among these corporations,
the Standard Oil Company is, of course, the most famous; still, the
teacher will do well to attempt to follow with his class the history
of some other industrial corporation as well--if possible, some
corporation whose operations have not stirred up so much opposition
as the Standard Oil Company. In estimating the effect of these
corporations upon the economic history of the country, one should
attempt to bring out the benefits which they have bestowed upon the
people as well as the evils which have resulted from their operations.

In attempting to regulate the activities of these corporations most
states have passed special laws and established special commissions.
In consequence, the newspapers are full of accounts of prosecutions
under these laws and by these commissions and the student should be
encouraged to read them. The national government, too, has passed
at least one law, the famous Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, with a
view to regulating these great corporations. More recently still, the
Bureau of Corporations was established, while at the present time new
legislation on this subject is pending in Congress. Yet with all the
agitation and with all the legislation, it cannot be said that the
problem is even on the verge of being settled. That will take, in all
probability, at least another generation.


The Literature of the Subject.

To recommend one or two, or even half a dozen books on this period of
American history is impossible. Most of the discussion is evanescent,
and books are antiquated almost before they have been printed. For
much of the subject matter to be discussed the student should be sent
to such manuals as (1) the American Annual Cyclopedia, and (2) the
Statesman’s Year Book. Much valuable material can also be gleaned from
(3) the annual almanacs published by many of the larger daily papers.
For statutes and government regulations, the student should consult (4)
MacDonald’s “Select Statutes,” 1861-1898.

Comprehensive and comparatively recent discussions of these subjects
will be found: (a) on trade unions, in (1) Ely’s, “The Labor Movement
in America;” (2) Adams and Sumner’s “Labor Problems,” and (3) Commons’
“Trade Unionism and Labor Problems;” (b) on railroads, in (1)
Hadley’s “Railroad Transportation;” (2) Haines’ “Restrictive Railroad
Legislation,” and (3) Ripley’s “Railroad Problems;” (c) on municipal
public service corporations, in (1) Bemis’ “Municipal Monopolies,” and
(2) Foote’s “Municipal Public Service Industries;” (d) on industrial
corporations, in (1) Jenks’ “The Trust Problem;” (2) Ely’s “Monopolies
and Trusts;” (3) Ripley’s “Trusts, Pools and Corporations,” and (4)
Tarbell’s “History of the Standard Oil Company.” Beside all these the
student will find much that is valuable in the current reviews and
journals, at least one of which should be in every school library.




English History in the Secondary School


C. B. NEWTON, Editor.

VIII. THE LATER HANOVERIANS.


The Industrial Revolution.

“The period which opened with Arkwright’s mechanical inventions has
been the commencement of a new era in the economic history, not only of
England, but of the whole world”--a new era indeed! The mind stumbles
over the multitude of forms which this introduction of new agencies
into human endeavor took, the infinite ramifications of influences
set in motion by machinery. The young of to-day, satiated, glutted
though they are with machinery, take an interest they could hardly
be expected to feel in more remote matters in the genesis of the age
on whose still advancing crest we ride: an interest, however, which
is very superficial, very unconscious of the deeper significance of
the industrial revolution. Some of the “leads” of that significance
are surely to be established as we approach the subject in the latter
part of the eighteenth century. Text-books vary greatly in the amount
of information they give as to the first inventions and the spread of
water power devices, followed by the still greater developments in the
stationary steam engine. In fact much of the history of invention is
obscure, and the details are entirely too numerous to give in a school
history. Nevertheless I think the teacher may improve on the accounts
in most of the school books, both in the way of lucidity and of
vividness. Try a careful study of pp. 505-519 of Beard’s Introduction
(which will take comparatively little of a busy man’s time), and see
how lively and realistic a tale you can weave out of it--you will
surprise yourself at the improvement you can make on your text-book! I
say this not that I honor the text-book less, but the freedom of oral
expression more. Then, too, one may lead naturally from a sketch of the
changed face of the land to the changes these new factories wrought in
old England, so stable since the days of the Conqueror, invaded at last
by a ruthless force irreverent of tradition, triumphing in disturbing
the established order.

But let us beware of resting on generalizations. “A new era in economic
history” is perfectly worthless as an entrant into the youthful mind.
As well speak of the cosmic forces in conflict with new physical
entities, or other “Olympian” abstractions. No, we must descend to
the hard pan of concrete things--the massing of population, the rise
of a new kind of commerce and a new kind of market, the making of
roads and canals to serve that commerce and that market, the changed
conditions of the laborer, and so on. Here, too, is a chance for “vivid
narration,” as the old rhetorics used to call it, and of all the wiles
of a _wise simplicity_ in instruction.


The Political Revolution.

From all of which the next step takes us to the revolution in politics
which made England for the first time a really democratic country. I
suppose it is more than possible to exaggerate the influence of the
industrial changes upon these political changes, but the tendency does
not seem to be in that direction. The Wilkes episode with all its
significance, the influence of the French Revolution pro and con, the
general trend of the age, are factors usually well built upon. The
agitations which shook the nation in the early nineteenth century,
the focussing of great areas of population in the new centers of
manufacture, the combination of the sense of industrial injustice such
as was evidenced in the excesses of the “Luddites,” with the sense of
political injustice of which the Manchester riots were a symptom--all
this not only wrought profound differences in the social fabric of
England, but was, I believe, the greatest single factor in bringing
about the great reform bill. Whether superlative or comparative there
is room for difference of opinion; but unquestionably this effect of
the actual machine upon the political machine is to be made a point of
in presenting to the class the drama of that peaceful (compared with
that of other countries) and salutary transition from a government
altogether of the land holders to an aristocratic democracy.

This revolution, which crowned the slow evolution of the British
Constitution, which was so unlike the cataclysm across the narrow
seas, was caused by a series of events stretching over the backward
centuries. That is a mere truism to our mature “grown-up” mentality
which has a taste for poking its nose into the roots of things and for
generalizing therefrom.

But not so with the fledgling mentalities before us--enough for them
that the very old time struggles helped along; that seeds of a free
spirit were not lacking in the teutonic blood; and that the events
of the seventeenth century did much to down the pride and power of
royalty. With this much for a foundation, the ultimate effects of the
new order of industry are comparatively simple to comprehend, and easy
to view, like the superstructure of the building which the unseen base
supports.


The Napoleonic Era.

There is a fascination which all of us feel, I suppose, both in the
French Revolution and in the looming figure of Napoleon. It is natural
enough, and needs no apology, but does need some curbing. I should
say, judging from my own experience, when one must keep sternly in
mind that English history is after all the prescribed route one is
pursuing, and to wander from it is as reprehensible as for the tourist
to deviate a hair’s breadth from his itinerary. The temptation to
digress is only heightened by the fact that English matters were quite
nearly concerned in the former, and might have been said to have been
thoroughly involved in the career of Napoleon. Then, too, none of the
class know anything worth speaking of about European history, and here
for once, at least, the various streams of national histories melt
into one river, and Europe becomes a vast theater for a single drama.
All very plausible, but nevertheless we must not dwell on the alluring
prospect too long or we shall be lost. The “Continental System,” with
its direct bearing upon England, is less interesting but perfectly
legitimate food for the English historian or historée. A fairly full
account of it taken from an article by Professor Sloane is quoted
pp. 520 to 537 of Beard’s Introduction. Much is of course available
on the Peninsular campaign and Waterloo, not to mention Aboukir Bay
and Trafalgar. Creasy’s account of Waterloo in the “Fifteen Decisive
Battles” is of course good; but for a bit of reading to the class for
purposes of ignition, nothing that I know of can equal Victor Hugo’s
fiction (somewhat adorning fact!) in Les Miserables.

A fascinating book on this period if one can get hold of it (it
is expensive, alas, so I advise borrowing) is Lord Broughton’s
“Recollections of a Long Life,”[3] which covers a considerable stretch
of time, for a single life, from 1786 to 1822, and is delightfully
intimate and realistic. I refrain from suggesting anything concerning
Napoleon having in mind the afore-mentioned temptation. Nelson and
Wellington, on the other hand, deserve portraits. The later appearance
of the “great Duke,” when he made so poor a hand at statesmanship is
one of the not infrequent examples of the soldier out of place in the
councils of state. The extracts pp. 656 to 662 of Cheyney’s Readings
are interesting in this connection.


Personalities.

The later eighteenth century teems with personalities, so that it
is difficult not to crowd the canvas and to nullify all individual
impression by the force of numbers. George III himself, much blackened
by American semi-traditions of thought is not as uninteresting or
as stupid or as objectionable as your pupil probably thought him. A
just view of King George is a worthy aim to set up for at least one
lesson. Lord North, too, always has an interest for Americans. But far
above these are Pitt and Burke and Fox. O for the chance to deal with
these men as we ought in the class room; to read what they said and to
examine what they did! Green has drawn William Pitt the younger in his
best style, pp. 790-791. For Burke one should go to Augustine Birrell’s
“Obiter Dicta” for an essay that is light in its touch but keen.
Trevelyan gives us Fox, though at too great length for busy men, and
Macaulay--well, no class has entirely received its due unless it has
heard the passage from “The Impeachment of Warren Hastings,” beginning
“The place was worthy of such a trial. It was the great hall of William
Rufus,” etc.

Time and space fail us, and the age of reform must wait for discussion
until next number, as well as the methods of review pertinent to the
otherwise pleasant month of May.

Reports from the Historical Field


WALTER H. CUSHING, Editor.


HIGH SCHOOL RALLY DAY.

An interesting instance of the influence of universities upon state
high schools is to be seen in Louisiana. The Louisiana State University
has arranged for an annual high school rally which this year will be
held on April 29th and 30th. At the rally there are literary contests
in English composition, in debating, in declamation, in vocal music, in
spelling, in English composition for the eighth grade, and in history.
There are also many athletic events. Prizes offered for the literary
contests are usually scholarships in the University. The following is a
description of the exhibit in history:

“Exhibit of Work in History. The exhibits may consist of any or all of
the following: Individual notebooks (containing topical outlines or
summaries based upon the text or upon collateral reading); papers or
reports to be read in the class; illustrations (pictures and maps);
map work of students (single maps traced or based on outline maps, or
atlases or wall outline maps filled in).

“No prescribed notebook or map work is suggested. It is desired that
the teacher use his or her own judgment as to the kind of work suited
to the class.

“The contest is limited to the tenth grade in each high school. The
work of the entire class is to be exhibited. The grade must contain not
less than five pupils. The teacher’s certificate as to the number in
class should accompany the exhibit.

“Neatness, accuracy, and good English will be considered as well as
evidence of proficiency in historical studies.

“It is advised that loose-leaf notebooks be used. Each should bear the
owner’s name and that of the school. The exhibit should be in place in
the University Library not later than 10 a.m. of the first day of the
rally.”

For the best exhibit of work in history a set of Woodrow Wilson’s
“History of the United States,” five volumes, published by Harper &
Bros., will be given to the school by Dr. Walter L. Fleming, Professor
of History in the Louisiana State University.


HISTORY TEACHING IN LONDON.

A committee of university and training college instructors and school
teachers is now preparing a report on history teaching in the London
elementary schools. One chapter of the report, “Aims and Scope of
History Teaching,” has already been prepared by the sub-committee of
which Mr. E. Bruce Forrest is chairman. The report, when completed,
will be published by the London County Council.


HISTORY TEACHERS’ EXAMINATION.

On May 21st there will be held at the Barringer High School Building,
Newark, N. J., an examination for high school teachers of history. The
subjects included will be Ancient history, American history, Medieval
and Modern European history, English history, and the principles
and methods of teaching history. Graduates of approved colleges and
universities will be required to take examinations only in these
subjects. Those not college graduates will be required to pass
examinations for the highest grade elementary certificate. Examinations
are open to both men and women. The schedule of salaries for positions
are for men $1,400 to $2,500, and for women from $900 to $1,800,
according to experience and fitness.


INDIANA ASSOCIATION.

The annual meeting of the History Section of the Indiana State
Teachers’ Association will be held at Indianapolis on Friday and
Saturday, April 29th and 30th. The program will begin on Friday
afternoon with a discussion of the Teaching of History in the
Elementary Schools. Professor H. E. Bourne, a member of the Committee
of Eight, will explain the principles of the committee’s report.
Criticisms of present methods in teaching history will be made by
City Superintendent Charles F. Patterson, of Tipton, and by County
Superintendent, Mr. Jesse Webb, of Franklin. On Friday evening will
be a joint meeting of the Teachers’ Association with the Indiana
Historical Society. Professor Bourne will speak upon “Our Early
Republic as French Travelers Saw It.” Mr. D. C. Brown, of the Indiana
State Library, will give an address upon “An Early Indian War.” On
Saturday morning the following problems of history teaching in the high
school will be discussed:

1. What can be done with the sources? Miss Minnie Blanche Ellis,
Bloomington High School.

2. Shall a history note book be required? Mr. W. C. Gerichs, principal,
Elwood High School.

3. How secure results with the collateral reading? Mr. W. O. Lynch,
Department of History, Indiana State Normal School.

4. Preparation and use of maps and charts. Mr. J. R. H. Moore, Manual
Training High School, Indianapolis.

This will be followed by the regular business meeting of the
Association. On Friday evening a subscription dinner will be given at
the Claypool Hotel.


ANNUAL MEETING OF THE NORTH CENTRAL HISTORY TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION,
CHICAGO, APRIL 1 AND 2, 1910.

REPORTED BY ALBERT H. SANFORD.

It is impossible to convey to one who was not present an adequate
idea of the spirit that pervaded the first session of the Twelfth
Annual Meeting of the North Central History Teachers’ Association;
this was the dinner at Reynolds’ Club, University of Chicago, in honor
of Professor Frederick J. Turner. The menu was simply “Food--a la
Hutchinson Café.” The “Refreshments” were talks given by Professors
James A. James, Albion W. Small, Guy S. Ford, James A. Woodburn, Thomas
F. Moran, and Dr. Reuben G. Thwaites, closing with remarks by Professor
Turner. The printed program was besprinkled with quotations from the
writings of Professor Turner, beginning with “The true point of view in
the history of this nation is not the Atlantic Coast; it is the great
West.”

Professor Andrew C. McLaughlin, the presiding genius of this occasion,
pitched the key at a point somewhere between gay and sad, running
readily from one extreme to the other. It was, of course, Professor
Turner’s departure from Wisconsin to enter upon duties at Harvard
that called the one hundred guests to assemble about this table.
Among them were some who had been students with him in Johns Hopkins’
University, many who had been students under his instruction, and still
others who are his colleagues in the field of history throughout the
Central West. Here was spontaneous testimony to the force and charm of
Professor Turner’s personality, and to the inspiration of his teaching.
Underneath the gayety of the after-dinner sentiments ran the note of
deep regret that the Central West loses the presence of this master
mind. No more fitting theme for a session of the Association could have
been selected.

Following the dinner came an address by Professor Paul S. Reinsch,
of the University of Wisconsin, upon “The Life of the State and the
Teaching of Government.” Preparation for the duties of citizenship is
less effective in the United States, said Professor Reinsch, than in
other advanced countries; hence the duty of placing more emphasis upon
the proper teaching of government. Local government should receive
fuller treatment. There should be more concrete study of the actual
operations of government and less committing to memory of the clauses
of constitutions that are only vaguely comprehended. Civil government
should be taught separately from history, else some of its most
important topics will never be reached; for instance, problems of city
and state organizations. Such, briefly stated, were some of the points
made in this interesting address.

The session on Saturday morning, April 2d, was fully attended, and
interest in the program which had been arranged by the president, Carl
E. Pray, of the State Normal School at Milwaukee, held the audience
until a late hour. Miss Lillian Thompson, of the Englewood High
School, Chicago, gave a spirited and practical talk upon “The Use of
Pictures in History Instruction.” That Miss Thompson has made a study
of child nature, as well as of pictures, was evident. She said, the
teacher must put herself in the pupil’s attitude and must realize his
poverty of ideas and mental images. She must be tactful and sympathetic
in satisfying the pupil’s curiosity, and in leading him to see the
essentials in pictures. Besides, the teacher must study the pictures
and plan carefully the presentation of them. Not the lecture but the
question method is the best for lower high school classes.

Much wisdom, drawn from experience, was packed into a brief paper read
by Professor G. C. Sellery, of the University of Wisconsin. This paper
cannot be adequately summarized in a few words. The old method of
teaching history insisted upon the learning of certain facts by force
of memory. Now we have a higher ideal--we ask pupils to understand,
rather than to remember. But we have gone too far in this direction:
pupils gain much discipline, but little knowledge. What is the remedy?
Treatment that will yield discipline requires time; hence, teach fewer
topics and teach them in detail, but emphasize the essentials. Then by
reviews drill upon the facts that should be remembered. Discipline and
knowledge are the two sides of the shield of history teaching.

“The Use and Abuse of Note Books” was the subject of a paper thoroughly
worked out by Professor Albert H. Lybyer, of Oberlin College. A
well-balanced position was maintained between the proper use of note
books as a means to certain ends, and their abuse in the hands of
pupils. No more use of them was recommended than could be properly
supervised by the teacher. There should be no note book requirement in
the grammar grades.

Not the least attractive of the topics presented at this session
was “The Value of History Pageant Work from the Viewpoint of the
English Teacher,” by Miss Charity Dye, of Indianapolis. Miss Dye’s
conception of the pageant is not that of a mere exhibition; it should
rather be the natural expression of school interests and activities
that have been thoroughly worked out in a serious way by students in
various grades. When so conducted, the school work that precedes the
presentation of a pageant has many valuable features. It arouses the
spirit of investigation, when students hunt out, organize, and build
up historical materials; it gives opportunity for the co-operation of
departments; it encourages in pupils self-identification with school
and community interests; it cultivates imagination and encourages
continuity of thinking. Pupils concentrate attention upon a growing
idea, and their work has cumulative force. This preparation gives to
classes in English occasion for exercises in narration, description,
argument, and the writing of letters, diaries, and ballads. This is
one method of overcoming the fragmentary nature of our school work and
engaging in activities that are socially and psychologically sound and
beneficial.

The final topic of the program was “Supplementary Reading in History
Instruction,” discussed by Professor Oscar H. Williams, of the School
of Education, Indiana University. Many sensible and practical ideas
were presented. Professor Williams recommended that striking passages
from original or secondary sources be copied and duplicated by the
mimeograph for class use; that pupils be encouraged to bring to the
school magazines from which valuable articles could be extracted and
bound separately in manila paper covers; that pupils be encouraged to
purchase for themselves certain reference books, especially historical
fiction. It was especially urged that the best results of collateral
reading appear when pupils become sufficiently interested to do this
work spontaneously.

In the business meeting preceding this program, it was voted to
accept the recommendation of the executive committee, that a special
supplementary meeting of the association be held in connection with
meetings of other associations interested in history teaching at
Indianapolis during the meeting of the American Historical Association
next winter.

Professor James A. Woodburn was elected president of the North Central
Association for the ensuing year, and Professor Earl W. Dow was made
vice-president. The association loses the valuable services of its
secretary-treasurer of the past four years, Professor George H. Gaston,
of the Wendell Phillips High School, Chicago; his place is taken by
Miss Mary L. Childs, of the Evanston (Illinois) Township High School.
The following were elected members of the executive committee: Dr. O.
M. Dickinson, Western Illinois Normal School, Macomb; Professor W. E.
Dodd, University of Chicago; Miss Victoria Adams, Calumet High School,
Chicago; Miss Ellen G. Foster, Evanston, Ill.

NEW ENGLAND ASSOCIATION MEETING.

The annual spring meeting of the New England Association was held in
Boston on Saturday, April 16, 1910, in the lecture hall of the Boston
Public Library. The morning session was devoted to Roman history and
to the report of the Committee on Historical Material. The opening
address was by Professor Henry A. Sill, of Cornell University, who
spoke on “Some New Points of View in Roman History.” Just one hundred
years ago Niebuhr began the epoch of modern critical historiography,
and for the first time applied the test of modern criticism to the
mass of tradition which passed current as Roman history. Forty years
later Mommsen took up the task, and in 1854 published his first
volume. The works of both writers were rapid and bold, but they
were works of genius and of intuition. The speaker then considered
certain characteristics of Mommsen’s work, among others specifying his
comprehensiveness, his thorough use of the sources, and especially his
modern tone. Mommsen did not make direct references to modern politics,
but through indirect references sought to make the Romans step down
from their pedestals and become real. We owe it to Mommsen’s history
that Rome does not seem a land of fancy.

Although Mommsen made over one thousand contributions with a total
of more than twenty thousand pages, he did not speak the final word.
Recently several attempts have been made to sum up the result of the
numerous special investigations which have been made since Mommsen’s
time, the speaker making mention of Pais, Ferrero, and especially of
Edouard Meyer, whom he termed the master of all. Of American writers
Professor Botsford has made a notable contribution in his “Roman
Assemblies.” Among the periods of Roman history which are being
rewritten are the Foreign Wars, the history to the fourth century
B.C., and the Revolution. Among the new points of view, Professor
Sill enumerated the influence of imperialism, war and its effects on
domestic policy, sea-power, international arbitration, capitalism, and
added that we might even have a pathological view of Roman history! In
conclusion, he cautioned against pushing analogy too far.

Professor Sill’s paper was discussed briefly by Professor H. B.
Wright, of Yale University, and Professor W. S. Ferguson, of Harvard
University, the latter citing an interesting dissertation by a
Roumanian teacher on the nationality of the business men of Rome and
the light it threw on certain problems of Roman history.


Historical Material.

An extensive exhibit of historical material, comprising maps, charts,
pictures, casts, atlases and models had been procured and displayed by
a committee of the Association consisting of Prof. Arthur I. Andrews,
of Simmons College, chairman; Prof. W. S. Ferguson, Miss Ellen S.
Davison, Mr. L. R. Wells, Miss Mabelle Moses and Mr. W. H. Cushing.
In his brief report Professor Andrews acknowledged the debt due
Teachers’ College both for the idea and for many models and pictures
loaned for this exhibition. The watchword of the committee has been:
“Show the attainable.” We have aimed, said Professor Andrews, to
place on exhibition articles and samples of articles that can, at a
reasonable expense, be introduced into any class-room. In addition
to the loans from Teachers’ College, much was imported for the
exhibition by Messrs. G. Stechert & Co.; other articles were loaned
by the publishers, and some were bought outright by the Association.
A special feature of the exhibit was the large number of the Hensell
and Rausch models, probably the largest collection ever displayed in
this country. As at the Teachers’ College exhibition, one of the most
helpful features was the collection of mounted pictures illustrative
of various phases of life and conditions, showing the possibilities in
this line where the expense is trifling. It is the intention of the
committee to prepare lists of typical collections of maps, charts and
models costing twenty-five, fifty, one hundred, two hundred and five
hundred dollars. After referring to the cost of various portions of
the exhibit, Professor Andrews summed up as follows: “It will be seen,
then, that two things are fairly clear; first, that a collection of the
best material, up-to-date in every way and including samples of the
best models, the best series of maps, the latest charts, and the best
pictures of every kind, could be got together by this Association at a
very moderate cost; secondly, such a collection, showing the exact cost
of each article, would be valuable to the teacher who has a limited
appropriation and who needs to see for herself in the easiest possible
way just what she wants and just what she can pay for.”

The enthusiasm of your committee has been aroused by the contemplation
of great ideas as to the permanency of this collection. We hope to
arrange for the proper housing of these exhibits, making it accessible
to teachers and classes visiting Boston, and we also hope to arrange
for transporting it to other parts of New England where it may be on
exhibition in connection with educational meetings. Undoubtedly it will
be a feature of the forthcoming meeting of the N. E. A. in Boston in
July.

Miss Ellen Scott Davison, of Bradford Academy, spoke briefly on some
practical uses of pictures, and told of the practices in German schools
which she visited last summer.

The guest of the Association at its luncheon was General Edward
Anderson, who spoke most entertainingly of his recollections of
Lincoln, Grant, Sherman, John Brown and other leaders and incidents of
the Civil War period. As President Evans characterized it, it was the
genuine source method of instruction by an accomplished speaker.

Before ordering for the fall be sure to inspect the

McKinley Historical Note-Books

These note-books consist of the McKinley Outline Maps combined with
blank leaves to constitute an historical note-book of 104 pages; the
back of each map and every other sheet being left blank for class notes
or comment upon the maps. Many teachers have required their scholars
to paste or bind McKinley Outline Maps in their note-books; the new
arrangement furnishes the maps already printed in the book, at a price
about the same as that asked for a note-book of blank leaves.

=Four Books in the Series=: For American History, for English History,
for Ancient History, and for European History.

=Price: 22 cents (net) each=

The note-books are made from a clean, strong, and heavy _ledger
writing_ paper, well suited to the use of ink or colors. Size about 8 x
11 inches.

Samples cheerfully furnished upon request to

COLLEGE CATALOGUE REQUIREMENTS IN HISTORY.

As a member of the Catalogue Committee in one of our smaller colleges,
it has been my privilege the past two years to study catalogues from
all parts of the country--perhaps sixty or more. Besides the various
general matters noticed, I have naturally turned for information
and help to the history courses offered and to the college entrance
requirements in history. This survey has given me several definite
impressions.

The requirements in history are generally not organised as are the
departments of English, Latin and Mathematics. Frequently they are not
definite in their statements as to just what they wish done. One of our
best northern colleges gives four lines to History; over one page to
Science; over five pages to English.

Several colleges prepare their requirements with care, although few are
above improvement. That is, one college will enlarge on the text-books
and supplementary reading, but say nothing of the methods of work;
another will do just the opposite. Among the best requirements noticed
in the South are those of the University of Mississippi, the University
of the South, and Tulane University. The most satisfactory one is
from Leland Stanford Junior University, which gives a trifle over two
pages, and includes both books and methods. Probably half a page would
be more than the average length in the catalogues examined.

Two articles in THE HISTORY TEACHERS’ MAGAZINE for October, 1909,
“Lessons Drawn from the Papers of History Examination Candidates,” by
Miss Briggs, and the editorial on “Method the Need,” have stimulated
thought. The following paragraphs are offered as suggestions in one
direction.

It would seem that we might claim two or three pages in the catalogue;
they could easily be filled. The following is one plan that might be
used:

The courses allowed as units.

[Then something like the following which is adapted from the catalogue
of Leland Stanford Junior University.]


Ancient History.

TEXT-BOOKS[4]--Goodspeed, “History of the Ancient World” (Scribners);
Morey, “Outlines of Ancient History” (American Book Co.); Myers,
“Ancient History,” Revised Edition (Ginn); West, “Ancient World” (Allyn
and Bacon); Wolfson, “Essentials in Ancient History” (American Book
Co.); or an equivalent.

For supplementary reading and reference, work in some of the following
is suggested: Botsford, “Story of Rome;” Cox, “General History of
Greece” (Student Series); Fling, “Source Book of Greek History;” Munro,
“Source Book of Roman History;” Pelham, “Outlines of Roman History;”
Shuckburgh, “History of Rome,” and Ginn & Co’s “Classical Atlas,” or
Kiepert, “Classical Atlas;” Tozer’s “Primer of Classical Geography.”

This is carried out for the four groups.

Then give general suggestions at the end: the work required of students
in definite statements; a few helps for the teachers preparing students
for the college, as “Report of the Committee of Seven,” HISTORY
TEACHERS’ MAGAZINE, a few _syllabi_ and _map books_.

Those suggestions may seem entirely unnecessary to the colleges and
universities in the northeastern part of the country, but they are
greatly needed elsewhere, as in many parts of the South where the
high school movement, though growing rapidly, is yet in its formative
period. Even with the splendid school system of California Stanford
gives details, and I fancy such help is needed in many of the
smaller high and private preparatory schools throughout the country.
Furthermore, if the best known colleges and universities wish to draw
their students from all parts of the country, they should make their
requirements so plain that they can be used in any section.

THE TOPICAL METHOD.

EDITOR HISTORY TEACHER’S MAGAZINE:

The college entrance examination seems to be a contest between the man
who makes out the questions and the teacher who aims chiefly or solely
to get his pupils by the examination. The teacher who desires mainly
to teach history and how to study it, and to whom the examination is
only an incident, is the “innocent third party.” The examiner and the
examination-crammer alike search the papers of previous years in the
attempt to outwit each other. It would never do to ask questions only
on the most important parts of the subject; the candidates would surely
know all about such questions, a most undesirable state of affairs! A
teacher who, perchance, would try to teach some of “the glory that was
Greece” and, to save time for some first-hand acquaintance with Greek
literature cuts off the Peloponnesian war with a single lesson may
be doing right, but his pupils may suffer when asked to describe the
Peloponnesian war after the failure of the expedition to Syracuse. He
may dwell on the spread of Greek civilization over the East, and his
pupils be asked to describe, with dates, Alexander’s battles. He may
emphasize the civilization of the Empire and his pupils be examined on
the lives of insignificant emperors.

In mathematics the topics to be treated in algebra are specified in
detail; and a syllabus of required or book propositions in geometry is
issued. In physics a list of experiments is furnished. In English a
definite list of books for reading and another for careful study are
prescribed years in advance.

It is in the air that certain objections to the field of ancient
history as stated by the Committee of Seven will be met by providing
a list of topics representing the desirable subjects for study in
the pre-classical and early medieval periods. Why not go further and
make it safe for a teacher who would subordinate the passing of an
examination designed to beat the crammer, to a sound knowledge of
essentials and substantial preparation in methods of historical study?
The worst that could happen would be that an increasing number of
candidates would know the essentials so well that most of them would
pass good examinations. But better still would be the possibility of
using the time thus gained for a thorough and intensive study of a very
limited portion of the field, whereby, to some degree, a right method
of historical study could be inculcated, thus securing better work in
history in college.

This plea is put forth not with a desire to make easier the work
of college preparation, but from a feeling that the efforts of the
conscientious pupil and teacher should reach out to a higher and more
enduring purpose than “beating the examiner.”
